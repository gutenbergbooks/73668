<p class="ph3">Music After the Great War</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the great war was declared, Leo
Stein, in Florence at the time, asserted
that the day of the cubists, the futurists,
and their ilk was at an end. “After the war,” he
said, “there will be no more of this nonsense. Matisse
may survive, and Picasso in his ‘early manner,’
but Renoir and Cézanne are the last of the
great painters, and it is on their work that the new
art, whatever it may be, will be founded.” Leo
Stein belongs to a family which, in a sense, has
stood sponsor for the new painters, but his remarks
can scarcely be called disinterested, as his Villa di
Doccia in Florence contains no paintings at present
but those of Renoir and Cézanne. There are
mostly Renoirs.</p>

<p>Of course a general remark like this in regard
to painting is based on an idea that there is no
connection—at least no legitimate connection—between
the painting of Marcel Duchamp, Gleizes,
Derain, Picabia, and the later work of Picasso, and
the painters (completely legitimatized by now) who
came before them. Without arguing this misconception,
it may be stated that a similar misconception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
exists in relation to “modern” music. There
are those who feel that the steady line of progression
from Bach, through Beethoven and Brahms,
has broken off somewhere. The exact point of departure
is not agreed upon. Some say that music
as an art ended with Richard Wagner’s death.
There are only a few, however, who do not include
Brahms and Tschaikowsky in the list of those
graced with the crown of genius. There are many
who are generous enough to believe that Richard
Strauss and Claude Debussy have carried on the
divine torch. But there are only a few discerning
enough to perceive that Strawinsky and Schoenberg
have gone only a step further than the so-called
impressionists in music.</p>

<p>Since the beginnings of music, as an art-form,
there has always been a complaint that contemporary
composers could not write melody. Beethoven
suffered from this complaint; Wagner suffered
from it; we have only recently gone through
the period when Strauss and Debussy suffered
from it. The reason is an obvious one. Each
new composer has made his own rules of composition.
Each has progressed a step further in his
use of harmony. Now it is evident that in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
way novelty lies, for an entirely new unaccompanied
melody would be difficult to devise. It is
in the combination of melody and harmony that
a composer may show his talent at invention. It
is but natural that any advance in this direction
should at first startle unaccustomed ears, and it is
by no means uncertain that this first thrill is not
the most delicious sensation to be derived from
hearing music. In time harmony is exhausted—combinations
of notes in ordered forms—but there
is still the pursuit of disharmony to be made. We
are all quite accustomed to occasional discords,
even in the music of Beethoven, where they occur
very frequently. Strauss utilizes discords skilfully
in his tonal painting; in such works as <i>Elektra</i>
and <i>Heldenleben</i> they abound. The newer composers
have almost founded a school on disharmony.</p>

<p>To me it seems certain that it is the men who
have given the new impetus to tonal art in the past
five years who will make the opening for whatever
art-music we are to hear after the war, and
I am referring even to occasional pieces after the
manner of Tschaikowsky’s overture, 1812, in which
the Russian National Anthem puts to rout the
<i>Marseillaise</i>.... Perhaps it will be Karol<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
Szymanowski of Poland (if he is still alive) or a
new César Franck in Belgium who will rise to write
of the intensity of suffering through which his
country has struggled. But it seems to me beyond
a doubt that music after the great war will be
“newer” (I mean, of course, more primitive) than
it was in the last days of July, 1914. There will
be plenty of disharmonies, foreshadowed by Schoenberg
and Strawinsky, let loose on our ears, but, in
spite of the protests of Mr. Runciman, I submit
that these disharmonies are a steady progression
from Wagner, and not a freakish whim of an abnormal
devil. I do not predict a return to Mozart
as one result of the war.</p>

<p>There are always those prone to believe that
such a war as is now in progress has been brought
about by an anarchic condition among the artists,
as foolish a theory as one could well promulgate,
and keep one’s mental balance. It is this group
which steadfastly maintains that, after the war,
things will be not merely as they were immediately
before the war broke out, but as they were <i>fifty</i>
years before. Now, it should be apparent to anyone
but the oldest inhabitant that the music-dramas
of Richard Wagner are aging rapidly. Public interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
in them is on the decline, thanks to an absurd
recognition, in some degree or other, everywhere
from Bayreuth to Paris, from Madrid to
New York, of what is known as the “Master’s tradition.”
Some of this tradition has been invented
by Frau Cosima Liszt von Bülow Wagner and all
of it is guaranteed to put the Wagner plays
rapidly in a class with the operas of Donizetti and
Bellini, stalking horses for prima donnas trained in
a certain school. Without going into particulars
which would clog this issue, it may be stated
that the tradition includes matters pertaining
to scenery, staging, lighting, acting, singing,
and even <i>tempi</i> in the orchestra. It is all-inclusive.</p>

<p>It must have been quite evident to even the casual
concert-goer that German music has passed its
zenith. It has had its day and it is not likely that
post-bellum music will be Germanic. In an article
in a recent number of “The Musical Quarterly,”
Edgar Istel reviews German opera since Wagner
with a consistent tone of depreciation. The subject,
of course, does not admit of enthusiasm. He
calls Edmund Kretzschmer and Karl Goldmark
“the compromise composers.” There are probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
not many Americans who have heard of the former
or his “most successful opera,” <i>Die Folkunger</i>.
Goldmark is better known to us, but we do not exaggerate
the importance of <i>Die Königin von Saba</i>,
the <i>Sakuntala</i> overture, or <i>Die ländliche Hochzeit</i>
symphony. Nor do we foreigners to the <i>Vaterland</i>
know much about Victor Nessler’s <i>Der Trompeter
von Säkkingen</i>, although we hear one air from it
frequently at Sunday night concerts in the opera
house. August Bungert tried to outdo Wagner
with a six-day opera cycle, <i>Homerische Welt</i>, produced
in 1898-1903 and already forgotten. Max
Schillings, whose name has occasionally figured on
symphony orchestra programmes in America, is
thus dismissed by Istel: “Schillings’ last work, <i>Der
Moloch</i> (1906), proves his total inability as a dramatic
composer.” Hans Pfitzner is another name
on which we need not linger. Engelbert Humperdinck,
of course, wrote the one German opera which
has had a world-wide and continuous success since
<i>Parsifal</i>—<i>Hänsel und Gretel</i>. But the music he
has composed since then has not awakened much
enthusiasm. <i>Hänsel und Gretel</i> is, after all, folk-music
with Wagnerian orchestration. It assuredly
is not from Humperdinck that we can look for post-bellum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span> 
music. We have heard Kienzl’s very mediocre
<i>Der Kuhreigen</i> and we have been promised a
hearing of <i>Evangelimann</i>. The name of Siegfried
Wagner signifies nothing. Ludwig Thuille wrote
some very interesting music in the last act of
<i>Lobetanz</i>, but that opera could not hold the stage
at the Metropolitan Opera House. W. von Waltershausen’s
<i>Oberst Chabert</i> has been given in London,
not, however, with conspicuous success. D’Albert
has written many German operas in spite of
his Scotch birth. Of these the best is <i>Tiefland</i>,
negligible in regarding the future. Leo Blech’s
unimportant <i>Versiegelt</i> gave pleasure in Berlin for
a time. Wolf-Ferrari, one of the most gifted of
the German composers, is half Italian. His work,
of course, is not notable for originality of treatment.
<i>Suzannen’s Geheimniss</i> is very like an old
Italian or Mozart opera. So is <i>Le Donne Curiose</i>.
His cantata, <i>Vita Nuova</i>, is archaic in tone, a musical
Cimabue or Giotto. <i>I Giojelli della Madonna</i>
is an attempt at Italian <i>verismo</i>. Richard Strauss!
the most considerable German musical figure of his
time. His operas will still be given after the war
and his tone-poems will be heard, but he has done
his part in furthering the progress of art-music.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
He has nothing more to say. In <i>The Legend of
Joseph</i>, the ballet which the Russians gave in Paris
last summer, it was to be observed that the Strauss
idiom exploited therein had fully expressed itself
in the earlier works of this composer. <i>Salome</i> and
<i>Elektra</i> represent Strauss’s best dramatic work,
and <i>Don Juan</i> and <i>Till Eulenspiegel</i> are, perhaps,
his best tone-poems. Richard Strauss, however,
is assuredly not post-bellum. His music is a part
of the riches of the past. One can easily pass
rapidly by the names of Bruckner, Weingartner,
and Gustav Mahler. Max Reger, I think, is not
a great composer. But there are two Austrian
names on which we must linger.</p>

<p>One of them is Erich Korngold, the boy composer,
who is now eighteen years old. His earlier
work, such as the ballet, <i>Der Schneemann</i>, sounds
like Puccini with false notes. It is pretty music.
Later, Korngold developed a fancy for writing
Strauss and Reger with false notes. And he is
still in process of development. What he may do
cannot be entirely foreseen.</p>

<p>Arnold Schoenberg is another matter. He is
still using as propaganda music which he wrote
many years ago. No public has yet caught up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
with his present output. That is an excellent sign
that his music is of the future. The string sextet,
<i>Verklärte Nacht</i>, which the Kneisel Quartet played
more than once in the season just past, dates from
1899. The string quartets were written in 1905
and 1908. The five orchestral pieces, the six piano
pieces, and <i>Pierrot Lunaire</i>, other music of his on
which what fame he possesses outside of Austria
rests, are all over two years old. Now the Boston
Symphony Orchestra has only recently deemed it
fitting to play the five orchestral pieces, and I believe
the piano pieces received their first public performance
in New York at one of the concerts given
by Leo Ornstein, although several pianists, notably
Charles Henry Cooper and Mrs. Arensberg, had
played them in private.</p>

<p>In 1911 Schoenberg issued his quite extraordinary
“Handbuch der Harmonielehre,” which is one
of the best evidences that, even though the composer
dies in the war, others will follow to carry
on the torch from the point where he dropped it.
Yes, Schoenberg, no less than Henri Matisse, is a
torch-bearer in the art race. He is a stone in the
architecture of music—and not an accidental
decoration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>May I quote a few passages from the “Handbuch”?</p>

<p>“The artist does not do what others find beautiful,
but what he finds himself bound to do.”</p>

<p>“If anyone feels dissatisfied with his time, let it
not be because that time is no longer the good old
time, but because it is not yet the new and better
time, the future.”</p>

<p>“Though I refrain from overprizing originality,
I cannot help valuing novelty at its full worth.
Novelty is the improvement toward which we are
drawn as irresistibly, as unwittingly, as towards
the future. It may prove to be a splendid betterment,
or to be death—but also the certainty of a
higher life after death. Yes, the future brings
with it the novel and the unknown; and therefore,
not without excuse, we often hold what is novel to
be identical with what is good and beautiful.”</p>

<p>With the single exception just noted it is not
from the German countries that the musical invention
of the past two decades has come. It is from
France. Whether Debussy or Erik Satie or Fanelli
first developed the use of the whole-tone scale
is unimportant; they have all been writing in Paris.</p>

<p>Erik Satie is one of the precursors of a movement—not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
important in himself, but of immense
importance as an indication. He is not a genius,
and therefore his work has received little attention
and has had no great influence. But it must be
remembered that he was born in 1860 and that his
<i>Gymnopédies</i> and <i>Gnossiennes</i>, composed respectively
in 1888 and 1890, make a free use of the
whole-tone scale and other harmonic innovations
ordinarily attributed to Debussy. A <i>Sarabande</i>,
written in 1887, should be tried on your piano. It
will certainly startle you. Satie has recently
achieved a little notoriety, thanks to Debussy and
Ravel, who have dragged his music into the light.
The more dramatic resurrection of Fanelli by
Gabriel Pierné has been related too often to need
retelling here.</p>

<p>Debussy, beyond question, is one of the high-water
marks in the history of music. <i>L’Après-midi
d’un Faune</i> is certainly post-Wagnerian in a sense
that <i>Salome</i> is not. Maurice Ravel, Paul Dukas,
Roger-Ducasse, Florent Schmitt, Chausson, Chabrier,
and Charpentier are all revolutionists in a
greater or less degree, and all of them are direct
descendants of the great French composers who
came before them. But what has been accomplished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
in France in the last few years? Dukas has written
nothing important since <i>Ariane et Barbe-Bleue</i>.
Debussy’s recent works are not epoch-making: a
makeshift ballet, <i>Jeux</i>, a few piano pieces; what
else? Ravel’s ballet, <i>Daphnis et Chloë</i>, is lovely
music. Some people profess to find pleasure in listening
to Schmitt’s <i>Salome</i>. It is unbearable to
me, danced or undanced. Vincent d’Indy—has he
written a vibrant note since <i>Istar</i>? Charpentier’s
<i>Julien</i>—a rehash of <i>Louise</i>. It sounds some fifty
years older, except the carnival scene. There is
live futurist music in that last act. When Charpentier
painted street noises on his tonal canvas,
were they of night or morning, he knew his business.
But certainly not a post-bellum composer,
this. Charpentier will never compose another stirring
phrase; that is written in the stars. Since
<i>Pelléas et Mélisande</i> and <i>Ariane et Barbe-Bleue</i>,
is there one French opera which can be called great?
There are two very good ones, Raoul Laparra’s
<i>La Habanera</i> and Maurice Ravel’s <i>l’Heure Espagnole</i>,
and very many bad ones, such as Massenet’s
<i>Don Quichotte</i>, the unbelievable <i>Quo Vadis?</i> of
Jean Nouguès, and the imitative and meaningless
<i>Monna Vanna</i> of Février. I do not think it is from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
France that we may expect the post-bellum
music.</p>

<p>Italy, long the land of opera, has held her place
in the singing theatres. Verdi and Puccini still
dominate the opera houses. But Puccini’s work is
accomplished. His popularity is waning, as the
comparative failure of <i>The Girl of the Golden
West</i> will testify. You will find the germ of all
that is best in Puccini in <i>Manon Lescaut</i>, an early
work. After that there is repetition and misdirection
of energy, gradually diffused talent. It does
not seem necessary to speak of Mascagni and Leoncavallo.
They have both tried for so long a time
to repeat their two successes and tried in vain.
Cilea, Franchetti, Catalani, and Giordano—these
names are almost forgotten already. Is Sgambati
dead? Does anyone know whether he is or
not? Zandonai—ah, there’s a name to linger on!
Watch out for Zandonai in the vanguard of the
post-bellum composers. Save him from the war-maw.
His <i>Conchita</i> disclosed a great talent; that
opera shimmered with the hot atmosphere of Spain,
a bestial, lazy Spain. This work I place with Debussy’s
<i>Iberia</i> as one of the great tonal pictures of
Spain. I have not heard Zandonai’s opera, <i>Francesca<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
da Rimini</i>, which was produced at Covent
Garden Opera House last summer, but I have been
told that its beauties are many. I hope we may
hear it in New York. Pratella is one of Marinetti’s
group of futurists, one of the noise-makers. I am
not so sure of Pratella as I am sure that many of
his theories will be more successfully exploited by
someone else.</p>

<p>Spain has been heard from recently—Spain,
which has lacked a composer of “art-music.” Albeniz
and others have been writing piano music and
now we are promised a one-act opera by Granados.
Perhaps in time Spain may lift her head high and
tinkle her castanets to some purpose, on programmes
devoted to her own composers. But now
it is Bizet, Chabrier, Debussy, Laparra, and Zandonai
who have perverted these castanets and tambourines
to their own uses.</p>

<p>I am no admirer of modern English music. I
take less pleasure in hearing a piece by Sir Edward
Elgar than I do in a mediocre performance of <i>Le
Prophète</i>—and I assure you that Meyerbeer is not
my favorite composer. A meaner skill than Sir
Edward’s, perhaps, lies in Irving Berlin’s fingers,
but a greater genius. I once spent a most frightful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
afternoon—at least nearly all of an afternoon—listening
to Elgar’s violin concerto, and I remember
a dreadfully dull symphony, that sounded
as if it were played on a throbbing organ at vespers
in a dark church on a hot Sunday afternoon.
The <i>Cockaigne</i> overture is more to my taste, although
I think it no great achievement. Has there
been a real composer in Britannia since Sir Arthur
Sullivan, whose works one rehears with a pleasure
akin to ecstasy? I do not think so. Cyril Scott
is interesting. Holbrooke, Delius, Grainger, Wallace,
and Bantock write much complex music for
the orchestra, to say nothing of piano pieces, songs,
and operas. (Holbrooke supplements his labors in
this direction with the writing of articles for “The
English Review” and other periodicals, in which
he complains bitterly that the English composer
is without honor in his own country.) I find
Scott’s piano pieces better. But since <i>Il Barbiere
di Siviglia</i> and <i>Le Nozze di Figaro</i> there have been
but few comic scores comparable to <i>Patience</i>. You
will hear the Sullivan operas many times after the
war, but one cannot think of founding a school
upon them.</p>

<p>I shall not hesitate on the music of America, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
in a country that has no ante-bellum music—one
cannot speak with too great enthusiasm of
Ethelbert Nevin and Edward MacDowell—there is
no immediate promise of important development.
However, in a digression, I should like to make a
few remarks on the subject of the oft-repeated
charge, re-echoed by Holbrooke in relation to British
musicians, that American composers are neglected
and have no chance for a hearing in their
own country. Has ever a piano piece been played
more often or sold more copies than MacDowell’s
<i>To a Wild Rose</i>, unless it be Nevin’s <i>Narcissus</i>?
Probably <i>The Rosary</i> has been sung more times in
more quarters of the globe than <i>Rule Britannia</i>.
Other American songs which have achieved an international
success and a huge sale are <i>At Parting</i>,
<i>A Maid Sings Light</i>, <i>From the Land of the Sky-blue
Water</i>, and <i>The Year’s at the Spring</i>. Orchestral
works by Paine, Hadley, Converse, and
others, are heard almost as soon as they are composed,
and many of them are heard more than
once, played by more than one orchestra. Of late
years it has been the custom to produce an American
work each season at the Metropolitan Opera
House, a custom fortunately abandoned during the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
season just past. No, it cannot be said that the
American composer has been neglected.</p>

<p>Finland has presented us with Sibelius, whose
latest works indicate that Helsingfors may have
something to say about the trend of tone after the
war, and from Poland Karol Szymanowski has sent
forth some strange and appealing songs.</p>

<p>But it is to Russia, after all, I think, that we
must turn for the inspiration, and a great deal of
the execution, of our post-bellum music. Fortunately
for us, we have not yet delved very deeply
into the past of Russian music, in spite of reports
to the contrary. Mr. Gatti-Casazza once assured
me that <i>Boris Godunow</i> was the only Russian opera
which stood any chance of success in America. He
has doubtless revised his feeling on the subject,
since he has announced <i>Prince Igor</i> for production
this season, an opera which should be greeted with
very warm enthusiasm, if the producers give any
decent amount of attention to the very important
ballet.</p>

<p>It is interesting, in turning to Russian literature,
to discover that Turgenev in the middle of the
nineteenth century was writing a masterpiece like
“A Sportsman’s Sketches,” a work full of reserve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
and primitive force, and a strange charm. And
Turgenev was born and bred a gentleman in the
sense that Thackeray was born and bred a gentleman.
In English literature we have travelled completely
around the circle, through the artificial, the
effete, and the sentimental, to the natural, the
forceful, the primitive. Art like that of D. H.
Lawrence, George Moore, and Theodore Dreiser
is very much abroad in the lands. Russia began
her circle only in the last century with her splendidly
barbaric school of writers who touch the soil
at every point, the soil and the soul: Turgenev,
Gogol, Pushkin, Dostoievsky, Andreyev, Tolstoy,
Tchekhov, Gorky, and Artzybachev, a noble group
of names. We find in Russia a situation very akin
to that of Ireland, a people commercially under-developed,
in a large measure born to suffering,
keenly alive to artistic impulse.</p>

<p>In Ireland this impulse has expressed itself almost
entirely through the written word, but in
Russia it has found an outlet in a thousand channels.
(The arts have grouped themselves together
in the glowing splendor of the Russian Ballet productions.)
Music, like literature, sprang into being
in Russia, fed on the rich folk-songs of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
Slavic races, during the nineteenth century; and
again like Russian literature, its first baby notes
were wild, appealing, barbaric, forceful, and sincere—the
music of the steppes and the people,
rather than the music of the drawing-room and the
nobility. Let us remember that about the time
Richard Wagner was writing <i>Tristan und Isolde</i>,
Moussorgsky was putting on paper, with infinite
pain, the notes of the scores of the poignant <i>Boris
Godunow</i> and the intense <i>La Khovanchina</i>. Since
then the Russian music world has been occupied by
men who have given their lives to the foundation
of a national school. Their work has been largely
overshadowed in America by the facile genius of
Tschaikowsky, who wrote the most popular symphony
of the nineteenth century, but who is less
Russian and less important than many of his confrères.</p>

<p>If for a time after the war one must turn to the
past for operatic novelties, one can do no better
than to go to Russia. It is my firm conviction that
several of the Russian operas would have a real
success here. <i>La Khovanchina</i> to many musicians
is more beautiful than <i>Boris</i>. It is indeed a serious
work of genius. The chorus with which the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
act closes has power enough to entice me to the
theatre at any time. I do not know of a death-scene
in all the field of opera as strong in its effect
as that of the Prince Ivan Khovansky. He
is stabbed and he falls dead. He does not sing
again, he does not move; there are no throbs of
the violins, no drum beats. There is a pause. The
orchestra is silent. The people on the stage are
still. It is tremendous!</p>

<p>Rimsky-Korsakow’s music is pretty well known
in America. His <i>Scheherazade</i> and <i>Antar</i> suites
are played very often; but his operas remain unsung
here. Why? He wrote some sixteen of them
before he died. Even so early a work as <i>A Night
in May</i> contains many lovely pages. It is a folk-song
opera built along the old lines of set numbers.
It reminds one of <i>The Bartered Bride</i>. First produced
in 1880, it does not show its age. <i>The Snow
Maiden</i> contains the <i>Song of the Shepherd Lehl</i> and
one or two other airs familiar in the concert répertoire.
<i>Sadko</i>, if given in the Russian manner,
would fill any opera house for two performances
a week for the season; and <i>Ivan the Terrible</i> is a
masterpiece of its kind. But the greatest of them
all is the last lyric drama of the composer, <i>The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Golden Cock</i>, in which this great tone colorist bent
his ear further towards the future than he had
ever done before.</p>

<p>The death of Alexander Scriabine recently in
Petrograd created little comment, although the
papers had been filled a few weeks before with descriptions
of the very bad performance of his
<i>Prometheus</i> by the Russian Symphony Orchestra.
Scriabine, another Gordon Craig, was too great a
theorist, too concerned with the perfect in his art,
ever to arrive at anything approximating the actual.
As an influence, he can already be felt. His
synchronism of music, light, and perfumes was
never realized in his own music, although the Russian
Ballet has completely realized it. (How
cleverly that organization—or is it a movement?—has
seized everybody’s good ideas, from Wagner’s
to Adolphe Appia’s!) As for Scriabine’s strange
scales and disharmonies, Igor Strawinsky has made
the best use of them—Igor Strawinsky, perhaps
the greatest of the musicians of the immediate future.
I hope Americans may hear his wonderfully
beautiful opera, <i>The Nightingale</i>; and if all the
music of the future is like that, I stand with bowed
and reverent head before the music of the future<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
(with the mental reservation, however, that I may
spurn it when it is no longer music of the future).
His three ballets are also works of genius.</p>

<p>It is indeed to Strawinsky, whose strange harmonies
evoked new fairy worlds in <i>The Nightingale</i>
and whose barbaric rhythms stirred the angry
pulses of a Paris audience threatened with the
shame of an emotion in the theatre, to whom we
may turn, perhaps, for still new thrills after the
war. Strawinsky has so far showed his growth
in every new work he has vouchsafed the public.
From Schoenberg, and Korngold in a lesser degree,
we may hope for messages in tone, disharmonic
by nature, and with a complexity of rhythm
so complex that it becomes simple. (In this connection
I should like to say that there are scarcely
two consecutive bars in Strawinsky’s ballet, <i>The
Sacrifice to the Spring</i>, written in the same time-signature,
and yet I know of no music—I do not
even except <i>Alexander’s Ragtime Band</i>—more
dance-compelling.) We may pray to Karol Szymanowski
for futurist wails from ruined Poland; a
rearranged, disharmonic version of the national
airs of the warring countries may spring from
France or Italy; but for the new composers, the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
names, the strong, new blood of the immediate
future in music, we must turn to Russia. The new
music will not come from England, certainly not
from America, not from France, nor from Germany,
but from the land of the steppes—a gradual
return to that orientalism in style which may be
one of the gifts of culture, which an invasion from
the Far East may impose on us some time in the
next century.</p>

<p class="ph3">Music for Museums?</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I&#8202; SAW people actually enjoying themselves at
a recent piano recital. During the performance
of some of the numbers they
laughed; at other times they nudged one another
and made comments. The conclusion of each piece
was punctuated by a certain amount of vociferous
applause, and an almost equal amount of disapprobation.
One group of pieces on the programme,
Claude Debussy’s <i>Children’s Corner</i>, was familiar;
as a result, it aroused less interest than some of
the other music played. Albeniz, one of the new
men who is making the list of Spanish compositions
extend beyond the folk-song, was represented by
his <i>El Albaicin</i>; Maurice Ravel by <i>Gaspard de la
Nuit</i>, a very successful attempt to paint atmosphere
and character in the very limited tonal
medium of the pianoforte; Scriabine by four preludes
and a sonata; and Leo Ornstein, the pianist,
by <i>Seven Sketches</i> and <i>Two Shadow Pieces</i>. Mr.
Ornstein’s compositions have no truck with majors
and minors, thirds and fifths, pentatonic and diatonic
scales. His descending fingers strike masses
of keys; some auditors seemed to think there is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
plan in these assaults on the board. Personally,
I am willing to wager that the last piano sonatas
of the deaf Beethoven meant just as little
to their first hearers. We have become accustomed
to the sweet and unsubtle way of the tonic and
dominant. Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Strawinsky
are yet discordant to our melody-soaked and
harmony-demanding ears.</p>

<p>Yet, if concert programmes are consulted, one
will find in them very little music earlier than the
eighteenth century. The symphony orchestra is
really a discovery of the nineteenth century. When
our symphony orchestras play Bach, Haydn, or
Mozart, the reënforcements, the rearrangements,
would astonish those old composers as much as
the electric signs on Broadway, could they be
brought back to hear them. Either one-half the
band—nay, two-thirds—must sit still during the
playing of these numbers, if the original body of
tone is to be preserved, or else some readjustment
is necessary. For instance, it is quite customary
to allow the full body of strings to play a Mozart
symphony, although the wood-winds and brasses
are not appreciably greater in number in the modern
orchestra than they were in Mozart’s time.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
Lack of proportion and over-emphasis are the
natural results.</p>

<p>It is only the composers who have invented the
modern orchestra, Berlioz, Liszt, Wagner, Strauss,
Reger, Strawinsky and Scriabine—to mention a
few names—who get justice done to their compositions.
In fact, as it stands, the modern orchestra
exists for the perfect playing of modern music. It
is a dizzy, vertiginous force; floods of sound are
let loose on the hearer to drown his sensibilities and
to make him “feel.” Now, there was something
very precise and exact and prim about the peruked
band of the day of Haydn, which would have
played the <i>Symphonie Pathétique</i> as if it were the
<i>Marche Funèbre d’une Marionnette</i>. Music in the
good old days did not cause women to swoon and
men to swear. There were no Wagnerites then.
(Are there any now?) The composer of <i>Armide</i>
would not have inspired an Aubrey Beardsley drawing.
So when the modern orchestra plays Mozart
it makes just a little too much of it. Mozart and
Strauss! It is the difference between Cimabue and
Michael Angelo.</p>

<p>The conflict between periodic conventions and
contemporary methods and tastes is always great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
and will always serve as an excuse for discussion.
There seems to be no adequate reason why we
should give up Shakespeare because we do not perform
his plays in the Elizabethan manner. After
all, a tune is a tune, and <i>Voi che sapete</i> would
probably sound very well played on mandolins if
Mme. Sembrich did not happen to be handy to
sing it. The Anglican church has found it well
adapted for hymnal purposes, as anyone knows
who has heard <i>Adeste Fideles</i>. So, perhaps, Bach
rearranged by Gustav Mahler, or Josef Stransky,
or anybody else who happens to have the time, is
to be listened to, just as we are all forced to lend
our ears several times a year, whether it be in a
concert hall or a restaurant, or on an ocean liner,
to Gounod’s idea of a Bach prelude.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of the old music which
gives a pleasant impression to the ear if it be not
heard too frequently. Mozart, Bach, and Gluck,
however, stand the test of frequent repetition better
than Beethoven. It would also be a mistake,
perhaps, not to give the students of music an opportunity
to hear past examples of the art, to
establish in their minds a knowledge of the successive
steps which have been taken in building up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
this arbitrary thing which we call “art-music,”
although it is neither the music of the Chinese,
who, after all, may be considered an artistic race,
the African negroes, the Indians, nor the Japanese.
It would not be advisable, perhaps, to have
any admirer of present-day art-music believe that
it was all that could be said or done in music; an
historical survey is necessary. For some of us
there is always the question of relative importance.
It may be a fact that nobody in the future will be
able to extract more beautiful arbitrary art-music
out of the air than has been composed by Mozart
and Wagner. We are sure that Berlioz, Liszt,
Meyerbeer, and Mendelssohn can be improved on
because they have been. Perhaps Beethoven’s
Fifth Symphony is really better music than any
which has been composed before or since. (Personally,
I do not for a moment think so.) For
the purpose of argument, however, it is necessary
to presuppose that some people set up standards
of this sort. There are those, doubtless, who are
really sincere in their devotion to the composers
whose names begin with a B; but there is a larger
group whose ears find it easier to listen not merely
to music based upon a certain scale, but to <i>certain</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
music based on this scale. As a result, one might
say that the very limited attendance on which our
symphony orchestras may count is largely made
up of middle-aged people who are never contemptuous
of familiarity.</p>

<p>The principle, of course, is all wrong. Still,
when every person in a vast population is expected
to enjoy arbitrary art-music, one cannot expect
perception or taste. In our civilization everybody
is supposed to “love” music. Poor though we may
be, we send our daughters to the music-masters.
From cottage to cottage the echoes of the pianoforte
resound and, especially in the beginning,
each pupil is given a taste of what is known in
the provinces as “classical” music. Czerny is
hauled out to teach the fingers how to be agile.
There must be a taste of Bach’s <i>Wohltemperirtes
Clavier</i>, a Chopin waltz or two.... Heller
is a favorite with small-town teachers, and then
the student may burst gaily into the intricacies
of the latest air by Irving Berlin. Now, why is it
that the newest of the arts—at least the newest
from the arbitrary point of view from which we
consider music as an art—is taught to almost all
the children of all the lands? They are actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
beaten with sticks to drive them to the keyboard.
To be sure, children are also taught to read, for
more cogent reasons. It would do no harm to anyone
to be taught to read music; but to be taught
to play it is like being taught to act. What if
we should all be taught to paint?—Well, after
all, why not?</p>

<p>The results are not heartening. The fact is
that over fifty per cent. of the audiences who attend
symphony concerts cannot carry a tune.
Naturally they are not averse to hearing Beethoven’s
Fifth Symphony played over and over
and over again, but I should like to ask these same
people how many times during the course of a
season they would listen to a masterpiece in words—<i>Hamlet</i>,
for instance. How much less often
would they care to hear a play by Bernard Shaw?—and
yet there are some overtures and symphonies
which every orchestra plays every season to its
patrons. Some of this music one also hears in
restaurants and in the opera house. It is monstrous!</p>

<p>I really do not think that a modern symphony
orchestra ought to be allowed to play more than
one Beethoven symphony a season. This fossilization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
would be deadening to any art. A set concert
programme is almost an occasion for despair
under the brightest conditions, but with no new
life in its make-up, it had better remain an unperformed
programme. When an orchestra is the
medium through which a new musician pours out
his inspiration to the world, there is meaning in
the organization. When it ambles idly through
Brahms and Bach it occupies the same place in
the world’s affairs that the museum does. Why
should all our orchestras insist, except on rare occasions,
on being museums?</p>

<p>We have seen that only an inert audience may
be counted upon from the ranks of the music students
of the country. More interest might be expected
from auditors prepared to be unprepared.
To be sure, every conductor is keen to put a few
“novelties” on his programmes every year. This
season, for instance, a symphony by Sibelius,
which has been played in Europe for some time
and has been performed here before, has been
hauled out again to make the critics foam at the
mouth. Igor Strawinsky’s early work, <i>Fireworks</i>,
composed and published in 1908, has been vouchsafed
us. Since then Strawinsky, who, to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
mind, is the most brilliant of the new composers,
has written three ballets, <i>The Firebird</i>, <i>Petrouchka</i>,
and <i>The Sacrifice to the Spring</i>, and an opera,
<i>The Nightingale</i>. Not a note, so far as I am
aware, of these most interesting scores has been
heard in New York, although Paris and London
are thoroughly familiar with them. Schoenberg is
as yet barely a ghoulish name in this country, to
be whispered shudderingly until some daring soul
makes the Austrian composer a conventional thing
of the past. The Kneisels have at last taken him
up, if that means anything, and, of course, Ornstein
has played him. The Flonzaleys have played
a quartet and the Boston Symphony Orchestra has
performed the five orchestral pieces. Chicago, too,
has heard these. This is as far as we have gone
with Schoenberg. There is really no use of referring
to so bad a performance as the Russian
Symphony Orchestra gave of Scriabine’s <i>Prometheus</i>.
We hear too much Strauss now. There
was a time when we did not hear enough. The
academic Reger was feared like the plague for
whole years. Now that his message means as
little as possible, he jumps from programme to
programme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>Symphony concerts, then, as they exist in America—and
to a lesser degree elsewhere—are museums,
where one may inspect bits of old musical
armor, tunes in <i>Sèvres</i>, tinkling lace shawls from
Brussels, or harmonious bowls of the Ming period.
The audiences are shameless so-called music-lovers
who dawdle through endless repetitions of
the <i>Euryanthe</i> overture, and who whisper exquisite
trifles to one another about the delights of an
audition of a Mozart symphony. Really there is
nothing so smug, so snobbish, to be found in the
world as the audience of a symphony society, unless
it be a string-quartet audience. Beside these
groups you find opera-goers are simple human beings.
Both the organization and its supporters,
then, we discover, are simply corrupted by cob-webs.
They are things of the past that persist in
going on. A live orchestra, built on living principles,
which played new music if it played at all,
would serve not only to develop new composers,
but also new ideas. One can talk intelligently and
even quarrel with one’s neighbor about a new
Strawinsky work. At best, if one is a critic, one
can write a column about how Gustav Mahler
doubled the brasses in a Beethoven symphony and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
thus became the most arrant of knaves, or, if one
is not a critic, one may say, “I like Mr. Stransky
so much when he conducts Liszt!” To be sure,
the snobs and the smug would be bewildered by
the novelties. Perhaps they wouldn’t even go to
the concerts, although that seems unbelievable.
But there would be new audiences. At a recent
concert of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, in
New York, Dr. Muck dared to place three unfamiliar
works on the programme. (God knows
this was an unusual proceeding.) Not one of these
was formidable; not one of them new, except to
those comfortable ladies and gentlemen who have
sat through concerts devoted to Beethoven and
Bach so long that they should know the tunes by
heart. Yet the protests were many and loud. I
think Dr. Muck really stirred up an interest in
music by this procedure.</p>

<p>But if our symphony societies are dead, what
of our string quartets? Chamber music! Its title
explains it. It is music intended to be played at
home ... <i>music intended to be played</i>, not
to be listened to, except, perhaps, by some doting
members of the performers’ families. Suppose
you play the violin and you can find another violinist,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
and a ’cellist, and a violist, you invite them
all to come to your house some night and you take
down Schubert’s quartets, or Tschaikowsky’s, and
entertain yourselves. Father, reading his paper,
listens listlessly.... Sister Mary doesn’t object
to giving her ear occasionally, but there is no
concerted attention devoted to you. Nor should
there be. People do not, as a rule, attempt to play
piano duets in public. Why they should play
string quartets I do not know. Yet you will find
the cult of the string quartet is almost a mystic
body. There is a great deal said about this being
the “highest and noblest” form of music (arbitrary
art-music), and a great many people are impressed
with the idea that to know the string quartets
of the masters in itself constitutes a liberal
education. To know how to play them does, in
fact, make for a certain education, but to listen
to them—well, that is a different matter. The
string quartet plays in the very dustiest part of
the museum in which “modern” concerts are given.
Its audiences are fanatics who have gone mad
over an old religion, and while they will listen on
occasion to trios, sextets, and piano quintets, their
idea of the limitations of the possible combinations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
of instruments is circumscribed....
To my mind, there seems to be no good reason why
we should not have a duet between child’s voice
and flute; two guitars and two mandolins make
very pretty music.</p>

<p>I really do not know whether it is the concert-going
public which makes snobs of the critics, or
the critics who make snobs of the public. It is
certain that the music critics are loftier in their
self-created mountain strongholds than almost any
body of people since the worthy mastersingers.
They are the cataloguers of the museum, and as
each set of performers takes out an old doll and
makes its arms and legs wobble, and teases it to
cry “Mama,” they express their delight or their
displeasure over the results. If a new doll, by any
chance, is brought in, it is quickly sent to the basement
by these judges, unless it imitates not only
in appearance, but in gesture as well, some old doll.
Montemezzi is a doll who did not win the disapproval
of the critics because they had been hearing
<i>L’Amore dei tre Re</i> or something like it all their
lives.... Zandonai, on the other hand....
New dolls are not wanted in a museum
which contains the works of Beethoven, Bach, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
Brahms. Pratella’s name does not even begin with
a B. But neither does Strauss’s, nor Debussy’s.
After all, however, if one writes criticisms one
must have a standard, I hear you objecting. Most
critics do, mercifully enough for their readers, for
if one’s standard is not to accept any innovations
after a diminished seventh, it at least gives his
readers an opportunity to be aware of what he
means when he says that a work is discordant.
When a seasoned examiner of musical criticism
meets this word he understands that the critic
means that the music under discussion is quite different
from that of Weber and Puccini. There
may be, on the other hand, very good reasons to
suppose that to an unprejudiced ear, one not fed
up on art-music, the new music may not be any
more discordant than the hum of a factory, the
roar of a city, or any of the familiar rhythmical
sounds to which our ears are so accustomed that
we accept them. The Hottentot and the Chinaman
find real pleasure in what we call discords,
and, as a result, they have achieved in their music
complexities of rhythm which would be beyond the
grasp of the ordinary composer of our art-music....
It is alone the critic’s point of view,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
well-defined, which makes him comprehensible when
he disdains to be more scientific in his criticism.</p>

<p>There would seem to be a better way, unless the
critic can describe his emotions as poignantly as
Pater painted his impressions of the <i>Monna Lisa</i>.
Why not a scientific description? For years columns
and pages have been pouring over to us
about the “discordant” Schoenberg, but nothing
which actually gives you an idea of Schoenberg
has yet appeared, at least not under my eyes. (I
might except a few paragraphs in Huneker’s article.)
One could give an idea of what the music
really was like, at least to a musician. Or one
could make a confession, such as I heard Alfred
Hertz make after the first performance in London
of Strawinsky’s very beautiful opera, <i>The Nightingale</i>,
in which instruments are combined with
such strange effect that it is almost as if the composer
had discovered a new scale of tones: “I am
considered a good musician. When I am conducting
an orchestra I can detect a false note in the
furthest bassoon, or the nearest flute, but in the
second act of <i>The Nightingale</i> I could not name
a single note.”</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IRONY certainly directed the workings of fate
when it was decreed, in this age of individualism,
that the group-spirit should dominate
the movements of the theatre, an institution in
which, not so many years ago, the individual
reigned, his head crowned with bays. Democracy
has two effects: it strengthens the individual and
it gives him the power to join with other individuals
in fostering the growth of his ideals. Thus
Max Reinhardt, distinctly individual though he
may be, has made his impression through his artists,
his actors, and his musicians. So has Stanislawsky
of Moscow, who in one instance solicited
the services of Gordon Craig. The Irish Theatre
movement, which developed so great a genius as
Synge and many lesser, but still important, writers,
such as T. C. Murray and St. John Ervine, was
essentially conceived in the group-spirit. But
more than any of these, the most brilliant movement
in the theatre of our time, the Russian Ballet
(I am referring specifically to the organization
under the direction of Serge de Diaghilew) has
relied to an extraordinary degree on the group for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
its effect—one which, on modern art, music, dancing,
stage decorations, and women’s fashions, can
scarcely be overestimated. I have heard it said,
not altogether as a jest, that the Russian Ballet
has had an influence on European politics.</p>

<p>There are still many people, however, who have
never seen the performances of the Russian Ballet,
who think of it only as an aggregation of
virtuosi, much after the manner of one of Mr.
Grau’s all-star casts in <i>Les Huguenots</i>. It is true
that the names of Nijinsky, Karsavina, Fokine,
Miassine, Bolm, and Fokina have inevitably
awakened the same sort of magic sympathy that
the names of Nordica, Melba, Calvé and the de
Rezskes once evoked. The misunderstanding has
followed in natural sequence. Nevertheless—and
this is said without any desire to depreciate the
value of the Russian stars—it is fortunate that
the ideal of the producers of these mimed dramas
is aimed higher than at the exploitation of individual
talent. Their ultimate goals are cohesiveness
and general pictorial effect. And this fact
makes it possible for the Ballet to give representative
performances with or without the aid of
any particular dancer. In the summer of 1914,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
for example, in the absence of the superlative Nijinsky,
the Russians made very lovely productions
of Rimsky-Korsakow’s <i>The Golden Cock</i> and
Richard Strauss’s <i>The Legend of Joseph</i>.</p>

<p>For any comprehensive view of the achievements
of the organization, it is essential to remember
that Mr. de Diaghilew’s Russian Ballet began in
Paris as an art exhibition; that is the secret. For
two seasons Bakst and other Russian painters hung
their pictures in the French capital. These two
picture-shows are now included in the official lists
of the Russian Ballet seasons, and by no means
accidentally, or for purposes of misrepresentation.
For the Ballet has, in a large sense, continued to
be a picture-exhibition, and in spite of the fact
that some of the novelty has been worn off by multiplied
imitations, the thing itself still retains a
good deal of the original impulse. The Russian
Ballet, on its decorative side, is entirely responsible
for the riot of color which has spread over the
Western world in clothes and house furnishings.
Without the Russian Ballet as an inspiration there
could have been no Paul Poiret, no Paul Iribe, no
George Barbier, no Jean Cocteau, no George Lepape,
no Marcel Lejeune. There surely would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
have been no “Gazette de Bon-Ton” and no department-shop
sales of striped and spotted fabrics
of every shade under the sun. George Bernard
Shaw did not stretch the truth when he said
that for the past five years the Russian Ballet
has furnished the sole inspiration for fashions in
women’s dress.... One does not need to remember
any further back than the summer of
1914, when <i>Papillons</i> and <i>The Legend of Joseph</i>
were produced, to follow him. The crinolined
ruffled skirts of the former ballet and the prim
Veronese gowns of the latter (recall Lillah
McCarthy’s dresses in <i>The Doctor’s Dilemma</i>)
have been repeated in a thousand forms. And so
we might go back, year by year, to the season
when Bakst’s <i>Sheherazade</i> launched the Oriental
craze which is still making itself felt in hamlets
on the Great Lakes.</p>

<p>These decorations, and the costumes which accompany
them, designed by such artists—many of
them well-known painters in Russia—as Roerich,
Bakst, Fedorowsky, Soudeikine, Golovine, Doboujinsky,
Alexander Benois, and Nathalie Gontcharova,
are the basis of the beauty of the Russian
Ballet, and they are so perfect in their many manifestations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
that no amount of imitation can entirely
spoil them. When Roerich’s scene for the
Polovtsian camp in <i>Prince Igor</i>, a composition in
dull greys and reds, with low, round-topped tents
and rising columns of smoke, was disclosed in
Paris, Jacques Blanche, the French painter, was
moved to write an article in which he hailed the
designer as the inventor of a new type of stage
scenery, and even called upon the easel painters
to learn a lesson in truth from this rugged Russian.
Roerich subsequently designed the very
beautiful green landscape of the first scene for
Strawinsky’s <i>The Sacrifice to the Spring</i>, and the
grewsome setting, between somewhere and nowhere,
of the second. To Fedorowsky are due the barbaric
decorations and costumes for Moussorgsky’s opera,
<i>La Khovanchina</i>. The dresses of the Persian ballet
in this opera, orange riots, speckled with patches
of deep green and blue, have been plentifully imitated.
Soudeikine devised the extravagant ostrich-plumed
gauds worn by the six negroes who
accompanied Florent Schmitt’s Salome on her decadent
way. And Nathalie Gontcharova, with exquisite
fantasy, designed the scenes and costumes
for <i>The Golden Cock</i>, a production in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
Russians showed that they were willing to go yet
further in the realms of color-combination than
they had before ventured. Bakst, of course, is
as well known to us as Aubrey Beardsley or Longfellow.
There have been books of his work on sale;
the magazines and newspapers have reprinted
many of his best designs; there has been an exhibition
of his original drawings at the Berlin Photographic
Galleries in New York. However, in
spite of the reproductions and imitations, I think
those who have not yet seen a Bakst production,
such as <i>Sheherazade</i>, <i>Daphnis et Chloë</i>, or the extraordinary
<i>Legend of Joseph</i>, on the stage may
prepare for a thrill.</p>

<p>The scene exposed on the very large Drury
Lane stage as the curtain rose on Richard Strauss’s
ballet was certainly very splendid in its majestic
beauty. The stage directions give some conception
of the picture:</p>

<p>“The scene, the stage furniture, and the costumes
are throughout in the manner of Paolo Veronese,
and thus follow, in style and fashion, those
of the period of about 1530. The Egyptian characters
wear Venetian costumes; Joseph and the
dealers who bring him to Potiphar, Oriental dress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
of the sixteenth century. The scene represents a
huge pillared hall in the Palladian style. The
pillars and ceiling are of bright gold with a greenish
sheen. The floor is inlaid with blocks of colored
marble. The background is traversed by a
raised loggia, also of gold, which is open to the
air on the farther side, and gives a view over gardens
with playing fountains, and distant wings of
the palace; the openings on the further side are,
however, curtained during the banquet by a vast
carpet of Flemish work representing the Earthly
Paradise—stretches of verdure, alive with exotic
beasts of every kind. The loggia has no balustrade,
but is open between the pillars from floor to
ceiling, so that the personages traversing it are
entirely visible from head to foot. On the right a
flight of steps leads up to the loggia. Over the
floor of the loggia an Oriental carpet is hung,
reaching down to the hall.</p>

<p>“On the stage in front of the loggia are set two
tables at right angles to each other; the one furthest
from the spectator is rather long and runs
parallel to the supporting wall of the loggia; the
other is only short, and joins the first at right
angles on the left. The table to the front is raised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
on three steps as a dais. On the tables are richly
chiselled vessels of gold and silver, high ewers of
cut crystal full to the brim with gleaming red
and white wines, and dishes in which lie, heaped
in profusion, pomegranates, peaches, and grapes
of unusual size: golden platters and crystal glasses
are before the guests. The guests—men and
women by threes, in opulent Venetian costumes—sit
at the farthermost side of the table at the back,
half concealed behind the vessels of gold, the crystal,
and the piled fruit. At the table in front
Potiphar and his wife, the latter in a robe of scarlet
brocade, cut very low, over which hang long
strings of pearls. At her feet on the lowest step
of the dais, a young female slave. The tables are
served by eight negro slaves in a semi-Oriental
garb of pink and gold, and on their heads are nodding
plumes of white and pink. Behind the dais,
in the angle to the left, under the loggia, Potiphar’s
bodyguard—gigantic mulattos, with breast-plates
of black inlaid with gold, of Toledo workmanship,
with black plumes and halberds of gold.
They also carry whips with short golden handles.”</p>

<p>The spaciousness of this picture, the sense of
splendor it conveyed, cannot be communicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
second-hand. A young Spanish painter, José-Maria
Sert, designed the majestic loggia, and
Bakst vivified the scene, truly Veronese, with its
women in gorgeous brocades, flaring skirts, puffed
sleeves, and stilted mules, the officers in waving
plumes, two of the slaves holding lank greyhounds
in check. One detail was essentially Bakst. In
the old Venetian costumes a panel of lace, down
the front, covered the opening made by the flaring
brocades. This Bakst removed, exposing the
legs of his women, in silken hose, tightly trousered
above the knee. This undergarmenting, in its inception,
is authentic, as anyone may see who visits
the Museo Civico Correr in Venice.</p>

<p>I have hesitated this long over <i>The Legend of
Joseph</i> because, in reproduction at least, it is one
of the least familiar of the Bakst ballets, not because
it is more interesting than <i>Sheherazade</i>,
<i>Daphnis et Chloë</i>, or a half-dozen other of this artist’s
productions.</p>

<p>In considering the factors which go to make up
the perfection of this organization it is necessary
to lay considerable stress on the importance of the
music. In each of the cities where the Ballet has
appeared a large orchestra of picked musicians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
(in some instances an organized orchestra, such
as Thomas Beecham’s in London) has assisted at
the performances. The music of the ballets, even
when adapted for this use, as in <i>Cléopâtre</i>, is of a
fine quality, and in the variety of the compositions
employed (ordinarily three or four ballets make
up a programme) and in the manner of their performance
there is the greatest amount of interest
for those who are more interested in hearing than
in seeing. Particularly is this true as the Russian
Ballet has been the means of bringing some of the
most radical and anarchistic of modern composers
to a hearing before the public. Since Tschaikowsky
wrote three ballets, no musician in Russia
has considered it less than an honor to write for
dancing.</p>

<p>Certain of the works performed have been taken
from the concert room, <i>l’Après-midi d’un Faune</i>,
for example, with the approval, and even the applause,
of Monsieur Debussy; and <i>Sheherazade</i>, in
spite of the protests of Rimsky-Korsakow’s heirs.
Balakirew’s <i>Thamar</i>, too, was programme music
before it became a ballet. But several works have
been written for performance by this organization.
Among these I may mention Maurice Ravel’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
<i>Daphnis et Chloë</i>, the music of which exactly illustrates
the action of the ballet but is not easily
transferable to the concert room, although Ravel
made an arrangement which the Colonne Orchestra
has played in Paris and the Symphony Society
of New York has performed in New York;
Debussy’s <i>Jeux</i>; Reynaldo Hahn’s <i>Le Dieu Bleu</i>;
Steinberg’s <i>Midas</i>; Tcherepnine’s <i>Narcisse</i>; Richard
Strauss’s <i>The Legend of Joseph</i>, which the
composer himself conducted for several performances
both in London and in Paris; and the three
really extraordinary works of Igor Strawinsky,
<i>The Firebird</i>, <i>Petrouchka</i>, and <i>The Sacrifice to the
Spring</i>. I have elsewhere expressed my great admiration
for the genius of this young man; it is
certainly my opinion that more inspiration is made
manifest in these three works than in any other recent
music I have heard in the theatre or the concert
room. Paul Dukas also wrote a ballet for the
Russians, <i>La Péri</i>, but although it was announced,
the production was finally made under other auspices.</p>

<p>Any concert-goer will immediately note the
fact that a good deal of the music in the répertoire
of the Russian Ballet is familiar to him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
Balakirew began his symphonic poem, <i>Tamara</i>
(the ballet is called <i>Thamar</i>), suggested by a poem
by Lermontoff, in 1867; it was concluded in 1882.
The composer wrote in 1869 that he had composed
parts of it as he “danced along” the street. The
Chicago Orchestra performed the work for the first
time in America in 1896. The Russian Symphony
Society introduced it to New York in 1908. When
the Russians adopted the work to use as a ballet
the critic of the “Morning Times” in London said
that the action did not fit the music very well, and
yet the story of the ballet is almost precisely that
of the symphonic poem, so that if anyone was at
fault in this regard it must have been the composer.
Here is the fable to which Balakirew
wrote music, in the words of the programme notes
(by William Hubbard Harris) of the Chicago
Orchestra:</p>

<p>“In the narrow Dariel Pass, where the River
Terek roars, covered with heavy mists, there rises
an ancient tower, in which there lived Queen Thamar,
an angel of beauty, a cruel, wily demon in
thoughts, and yet at the same time divine. At
her enchanting call the passing traveller entered
the tower to take part in the banquet in progress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
there. Shouts and cries of revelry awakened echoes
in the darkness, as if at a great feast a hundred
young, pleasure-loving men and women were
gathered, or as if, in that great tower, erstwhile
forbidding, the celebration of funeral rites were
taking place. At the break of day gloomy silence
again reigned, broken only by the foaming Terek
as it hurried away a corpse. At this moment there
appeared at the window a pale shadow. It waved
afar a last farewell to the loved one. That farewell
breathed such tender ecstasy, the voice which
uttered it was so sweet, that its every accent, filled
with promise, seemed to tell of near, unspeakable
happiness.”</p>

<p>Only in its conclusion does the ballet action vary
from this story. The Queen lures the Prince to
his doom, dances with him as the centre of a bacchanale,
and then gives him the knife-thrust, as
her slaves hurl him through an opened door into
the river. But as the curtain falls we see her, not
waving farewell to her old victim, but waving welcome
to a new one.</p>

<p>Perhaps the composer really was at fault, because
the music has never made a profound impression
in this country. Here is W. J. Henderson’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
account of it in “The Sun,” following the
performance by the Russian Symphony Society:</p>

<p>“Tamara was a queen, and she dwelt by the
River Terek in an ancient tower, where she was
wont to indulge in nights <i>à la Cléopâtre russe</i>. In
the mornings the dead bodies of her lovers went
floating down the stream, while she sang exquisite
love-songs, just as if her lovers could be lured back.
In the music of Balakirew one could hear the river,
which sounded much like the Rhine, even to suggestions
of the Drachenfels. The riotous nights
were perhaps less clearly indicated. They were
somewhat repressed, muffled, as it were. Perhaps
Tamara, out of consideration for the neighbors,
used to shut the windows when she was holding
high jinks on the banks of the blue Terek in the
Caucasus. But they had long nights up there,
for the listener sitting outside the tower (in a hard
orchestra chair) and waiting for the exquisite love-song,
grew stiff and cold. And, after all, it was
a mean little love-song, because it had no tune,
and it would not have lured a red-headed boy,
let alone a dead man.”</p>

<p>However, Mr. Henderson had not seen Karsavina
as the wicked queen when he wrote those lines,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
nor had he seen Bakst’s gorgeous Georgian costumes—a
variant, it is true, of the greens and
blues with which he had decorated <i>Sheherazade</i>.
The fault of the ballet, as a whole, is that it is
reminiscent of <i>Sheherazade</i>; and yet it is effective
and has persisted in the répertoire of the Russians
since it was first given in 1912. The overdresses
of the women gave rise to one of the fashions in
women’s gowns which spread over our world two
years ago.</p>

<p>Rimsky-Korsakow’s <i>Sheherazade</i> is another matter.
The music was not written to accompany the
story used in the ballet, and yet it fits it perfectly.
Still, Mme. Rimsky-Korsakow (the composer, of
course, is dead) protested violently against what
she called a desecration of her husband’s intention,
when the ballet was first produced. (A similar
protest was lodged against the organization in
1914, when it produced Rimsky-Korsakow’s last
opera, <i>The Golden Cock</i>, with a double cast, one
choreographic and one vocal, although the opera
had been written to be <i>sung</i>.) No piece of music
is better known in the concert hall than this, and
any concert-goer will remember the violin theme
which portrays the last of the Sultan’s wives, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
she relates the four stories from the “Arabian
Nights” which the four movements of the Suite
describe. The ballet follows the action of the prologue
of these stories; the women of the harem
steal the keys from the grand eunuch and let loose
the black slaves for a drunken revel of lust, which
is interrupted by the sudden return of the sultan
and death to all concerned. The third movement,
that which in the Suite describes the love of the
young prince and the young princess, was omitted
from Fokine’s original arrangement of the ballet,
but in 1914 he added this movement to the action.
<i>Sheherazade</i> has been considered since the time it
was first produced in Paris some six years ago, the
masterpiece of the Russians. It made the designer
of its scenery and costumes, Leon Bakst, famous.
His color-scheme, mostly of greens, blues, and
oranges, has been frequently imitated in later theatrical
productions. Karsavina’s Zobeide is a suggestive
picture of languorous lust, and Nijinsky,
as the principal slave, alternates between surprising
leaps into the air and the most lascivious gestures,
as, like some animal, he paws the reclining
Sultana.</p>

<p><i>L’Après-midi d’un Faune</i> is as well known as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
<i>Sheherazade</i> in the concert room. This was the
first ballet which Nijinsky staged (he also enacted
the principal rôle). The music was written by Debussy
as a prelude to Mallarmé’s somewhat obscure
poem. An English translation, at least an acceptable
one, has hitherto been lacking, but Walter
Conrad Arensberg’s very sympathetic and understanding
version has just appeared; were it not
for its length I should like to transcribe it here.
When Debussy’s work is performed Edmund
Gosse’s summary of his idea of the meaning of the
poem (with which, by the way, the poet expressed
himself as entirely pleased) usually appears in the
programme notes. But Debussy’s music is called
a <i>prélude</i> to the poem and so the action of the ballet
is a prelude to the wonderings of Mallarmé’s
faun. This is the scenario as it was printed in the
programmes given out for the first Paris performances:</p>

<p>“Ce n’est pas <i>l’Après-midi d’un Faune</i> de Stéphane
Mallarmé; c’est, sur le prélude musical à cet
épisode panique, une courte scène qui la précède:</p>

<p>“Un Faune sommeille;</p>

<p>“Des Nymphes le dupent;</p>

<p>“Une écharpe oubliée satisfait son rêve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>“Le rideau baisse pour que le poème commence
dans toutes les mémoires.”</p>

<p>There are, I think, seven nymphs engaged in
the performance. Their dresses and their action
are suggestive of the figures of Greek vases and
bas-reliefs. One after another they flee from the
strangely misunderstanding faun, until one, bolder
than the others, approaches, almost to remain. The
faun still does not understand and she, too, flees,
dropping her scarf behind her. This the faun
seizes and, as the curtain descends, returning to
his rock, he presses this scarf to his lips and breast,
at last, apparently, something more than the faun
he has been. Nijinsky in this pantomime (it can
scarcely be called a ballet) suggests all that the
poem and the music call forth in imaginative
minds. He has dehumanized the characters and,
in a sense, thereby taken away the sting of the too
intense voluptuousness of the action. However, in
spite of this fact, and the further one that Monsieur
Debussy, unlike Mme. Rimsky-Korsakow,
not only approved of the use of his music in this
form but even applauded it, the first performance
in Paris (1912) was roundly hissed. Paul Souday,
a well-known critic, led the opposition, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
Rodin took up the cudgels for the defence. “Accusé
d’avoir ‘offensé la morale,’ Nijinsky s’est empressé
de donner satisfaction à M. Paul Souday en
supprimant sa ‘mimique indécente’ à la fin du ballet.
Et pourtant, son illusoire possession de la
nymphe enfuiée, ce corps étendu sur le voile encore
parfumé d’elle, c’était beau!” wrote Gauthier-Villars.
It is true that Nijinsky altered his original
performance for a few evenings; then, however,
he returned to his original conception. Meanwhile,
the troup moved to London, where <i>l’Après-midi
d’un Faune</i> was acclaimed above all the other
ballets, and almost invariably <i>repeated</i>. Since then
it has seldom been given in London and Paris without
the audience demanding a repetition.</p>

<p><i>Les Sylphides</i>, <i>Papillons</i>, <i>Carnaval</i>, and <i>Le
Spectre de la Rose</i>, are all exquisite studies of a
different style from the three ballets I have mentioned.
<i>Carnaval</i> is undoubtedly the best of the
lot, although Nijinsky as the rose ghost (the fable
was suggested by a poem of Théophile Gautier)
who comes to a young girl in a dream and bounds
out of the window, like a spirit, at dawn, is in his
most poetical mood. <i>Papillons</i> is the newest of
these four ballets, and for it Bakst designed some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
charming crinolined dresses. Pierrot, in the garden,
after the dance, has set a candle to catch butterflies,
and as the dancers flit out, each pretending
to be a butterfly, he tries to catch them, until the
coming of their parents to take them home teaches
him the bitter truth that they are only young
girls. The music is by Schumann, orchestrated by
Tcherepnine. <i>Les Sylphides</i> is little more than a
suite of dances in a charming adaptation by Bakst
of the conventional ballet costume. Glazunow and
other Russian composers have orchestrated these
Chopin waltzes, mazurkas and preludes. In <i>Carnaval</i>
(orchestrated by Tcherepnine, Glazunow,
Liadow, and Rimsky-Korsakow) the fanciful names
by which Schumann designated several movements
in these delightful piano pieces are transferred to
the characters. Nijinsky is the Harlequin; Karsavina,
Colombine, etc., while such pieces as <i>Dancing
Letters</i> and <i>Paganini</i> are used as divertissements.
The scene, with the two Victorian sofas at the back
and Pierrot lying over the footlights, is charming.
The principal characters are those of the <i>Commedia
dell’ Arte</i>, while the other dancers are dressed
after the period of about 1830.</p>

<p><i>Le Dieu Bleu</i> I have not seen, but I transfer the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
following account of it from the “London Times”
of February 28, 1913, in which the critic says that
“it introduces us to Mme. Karsavina and M. Nijinsky
in two new rôles which suit them well, and
it gives good opportunities for the combination
of music, dancing, and spectacle for which M. de
Diaghilew’s troup is famous—a combination designed
this time to suggest what Goldsmith’s Citizen
of the World had in mind when he spoke of the
‘furniture, frippery, and fireworks of China.’ The
scene is not precisely China in this case, but ‘India
of the fables,’ which in the theatre comes to much
the same thing, the point only being that it is the
Far Orient, where a glamour of riotous colour is
thrown over man’s actions, and where gods and
monsters are as near to us and as alive as the
priests and populace who worship them.</p>

<p>“When the curtain goes up we see M. Bakst’s
design of a temple cut into a rock, with a glimpse
of the sky seen through a cleft at the back, and in
the middle a pool on which is floating (or ought
to have been, for it was invisible last night) the
sacred lotus. A young man is about to be initiated
into the priesthood. He is surrounded by a crowd
of worshippers, who bring offerings of fruits,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
flowers and peacocks to the shrine, and, generally
speaking, occupy themselves in providing the
requisite amount of furniture and frippery. Suddenly
there is a tumult at the back, and a young
girl (Mme. Karsavina) pushes her way in past
the guards and falls at the feet of her lover, the
would-be initiate, imploring him not to desert her
for the priesthood. He is at first indifferent, but
gradually his religious ecstasy passes off as she
recalls their old life together, and eventually, with
an abrupt gesture, he throws himself into her arms.
The priests, in consternation, hurry him off into
the back premises, and after handcuffing the girl,
leave her in the darkness, where (like Tamino in
the caverns) she is told she will meet her trial and
punishment. After long moments of suspense,
during which night falls, she pushes open a door
through which she sees a chance of escape, and immediately
seven obscene monsters crawl out and
are about to drag her with them when, in despair,
she appeals to the sacred lotus in the pool. The
lotus thereupon turns into the goddess, who rises
with the blue god from the water. And then the
fireworks began, for the blue god was M. Nijinsky,
who at once set to work to draw the teeth, so to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
speak, of the monsters and to make even the trees
and flowers ‘bow themselves when he did dance,’
thus proving satisfactorily that M. Salomon Reinach
and his friends knew what they were about in
maintaining that Orpheus came over the mountains
from the East. The miracle accomplished,
the priests come in to take note of it, the young
lovers fall into each other’s arms, the goddess retires
to the lake, and the god goes up a staircase,
which is disclosed behind by the removal of a mountain,
and remains glued to it, in spite of the stage
directions that he is supposed to fly to heaven.
Being a god, he presumably thought he could
please himself.</p>

<p>“The scenario does not give quite so many opportunities
to M. Reynaldo Hahn as to MM. Bakst
and Fokine, who are responsible for the pictorial
and choreographic sides of the ballet. The theme
associated with the god is the most striking. The
dance with the peacocks is attractive, there are
some beautiful moments when the young girl appeals
to her lover, and their duet of joy at the end
is spirited, but much of the music is lacking in
character and the energy of the dance. It is written
with the beautifully clear technique to which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
M. Hahn has accustomed us, but there is little
driving force in it, and not a touch of passion in
the scenes where passion is wanted to give contrast
to the personal movements of the crowd or
the calm atmosphere of the divinities.”</p>

<p><i>Le Pavilion d’Armide</i> is a graceful combination
of two picturesque periods of romantic art, for a
French Vicomte, storm-stayed on his travels, is
offered hospitality by a Marquis, who lodges him
in a pavilion of his castle, where the Gobelin tapestry
comes to life during the night. The whole
thing is, of course, a dream, in which the Vicomte
sees in the Magician of the tapestry the person of
his host, and himself plays the part of Rinaldo
(the characters are those of Quinault’s play set to
music by Lulli and Gluck). When the change
comes and Armida and her court come to life, what
really comes to life is the court of Versailles; here is
the Grand Monarque himself, and there the most
enchanting group of knights in pink with feather
head-dresses dance with ladies whose costumes
combine the grace of Watteau with the conventional
dancing-skirt with the happiest results.</p>

<p>In the dances from <i>Prince Igor</i>, accompanied by
a chorus, the Russians loosen their restraint to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
degree which would mean a totally unrestrained
performance in the hands of another group of
dancers. It is almost impossible to believe, after
witnessing these wild Polovtsian dances, that the
action has been perfectly ordered by Fokine and
can be repeated exactly at any time. The ballet
occupies almost all of the fourth act of Borodine’s
opera. I believe that the choruses to which
these dances are performed were sung at a concert
of the MacDowell Chorus in Carnegie Hall,
March 3, 1911. The New York Winter Garden
once utilized the music for a ballet. The scene
used by the Russians, painted by Roerich, is marvelously
suggestive of barbarism; the now languorous,
now passionate music, pulsing with
rhythm, is admirably adapted to dancing. Usually
Mme. Fokina and Bolm are seen in these
dances, but it is the ballet corps itself which becomes
the important feature in their success.</p>

<p>“How excellently,” says one foreign critic,
“every means that the theatre offers has been made
use of to produce the desired effect; the menace of
the coming cloud of barbarians that is to lie for
centuries on the desolate face of Russia (for we are
in the camp of the Polovtsians, forerunners of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
great invasion); not the loud blustering of a Tamburlaine
the Great, but the awful, quiet vigor, half
melancholy, half playful, of a tribe that is but a
little unit in the swarm; the infinite horizons of
the steppe, with the line of the buried <i>tumuli</i>
stretching away to endless times and places, down
the centuries into Siberia; the long-drawn, resigned,
egoless music (Borodine drew his themes
from real Tartar-Mongol sources); the women
that crouch, unconscious of themselves, or rise and
stretch lazy limbs, and in the end fling themselves
carelessly prone when their dance is over; the savage-joyful
panther leaping of the men; the stamping
feet and quick, nerve-racking beat of the drum;
and more threatening than all, the gambolling of
the boys, like kittens unwittingly preparing themselves
for the future chase.”</p>

<p>But whose is the guiding hand, the hand that
combines the rhythms, the colors, and the human
element in these works? It is Fokine’s; without
Fokine I do not see very well how these ballets
could come into existence. (I am now speaking
of Fokine, of course, entirely as a producer. He
is also known as a dancer. One must bear in mind,
also, that Nijinsky’s three ballets—he contrived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
the action for <i>l’Après-midi d’un Faune</i>, <i>Jeux</i>, and
<i>The Sacrifice to the Spring</i>—were very original
and effective.) Until Fokine began to work, the
ballet-master had been content to arrange all his
<i>coryphées</i> in straight lines across the stage, each
dancer making the same simultaneous movement
as her neighbor. Fokine divined the ineffectiveness
of this false symmetry. He divided his forces
into many groups, each group a unit in movement.
(The ultimate result of the application of this
principle was Nijinsky’s staging of <i>The Sacrifice
to the Spring</i>, in which each dancer was set a separate
simultaneous task.) Nor did Fokine allow
any one group of dancers the whole of any movement
in the music. He subdivided the movements
into phrases. He really divided his ballet into
choirs, just as Richard Strauss and Reger subdivided
the orchestra, in which, in the time of
Bellini and Donizetti, large bodies of the strings
used to play in unison. Then each choir was given
certain phrases to interpret, some in the background,
some in the foreground, until the polyphony
of the music was perfectly synchronized with
the action of the ballet. Many of the ideas for
Fokine’s ballets were derived from pictures. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
possible to see at once the pictorial resemblance
between <i>The Legend of Joseph</i> and Veronese’s
<i>The Marriage at Cana</i>, or between <i>Midas</i> and
Mantegna’s <i>Parnasse</i> in the Louvre. But Fokine
also learned how to control movement, and how to
preserve balance from pictures. In the Accademia
di Belle Arti in Venice there is a room devoted to
large paintings by Gentile Bellini and Vittore Carpaccio,
depicting events in Venetian history. In
one of them is a procession, and a study of the
different groups of marchers and bystanders will
give you an excellent idea of the effective and pictorial
intricacy of a Fokine ballet. In <i>The Legend
of Joseph</i> Fokine attains one of his most thrilling
effects in the last scene, where the handmaidens of
the refused Potiphar’s wife, clad in black gauze,
with bare arms and legs, wave their arms in a
frenzy of hysterical disdain at the offending Joseph.
Shortly after seeing the ballet, in walking
through the Egyptian rooms of the British Museum,
I came across an Egyptian fresco which almost
seemed to me at first, in the exact spirit in
which Fokine had caught its feeling, to be a
photograph of the action I had seen on the
stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>Russians are natural dancers. It is said that
only Russians and Poles can learn to do the mazurka
properly, in which the women engage in that
peculiar gliding step which someone characterized
as the definite expression of Meredith’s phrase,
“gliding women.” So, under the guidance of Fokine,
with the inspiration which such music and
color as are provided for them can give, the Russians
engaged in the carrying out of these ballets
easily rise to an unattainable (for other dancers)
height of seeming spontaneity. They have that
“like-to-do-it” and creative (as opposed to reproductive)
air which every stage director knows is
almost impossible to instill into a large company
with any hope that it will be retained after the first
performance. But the Russians never lose it. A
ballet, given so often as <i>Sheherazade</i>, during a period
extending over many seasons, always seems
freshly produced. There are no slovenly details.
The wild orgy of the Polovtsian dances of <i>Prince
Igor</i> is invariably exposed with a feeling on the
part of the spectator that he is witnessing the intense
enjoyment of the participants.</p>

<p>Another important point is the variety in the
ballets, a variety which covers not only subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
and music, but also treatment in decoration and
staging, so that such an ultra-modern work as <i>The
Sacrifice to the Spring</i>, staged by Nijinsky in an
attempt to emulate the style of the futurists in
painting, with music by Strawinsky, who might be
called a master of dissonance, and with decorations
in hard and primitive colors by Roerich, finds itself
naturally side by side with the charming and
poetic <i>Sylphides</i>, gracefully staged by Fokine,
with music by Chopin (orchestrated), and with
decorations in pale green and white by Bakst. Of
course, some ballets, because of their fables, or
the nature of their music, naturally resemble one
another. <i>Sheherazade</i>, <i>Cléopâtre</i>, and <i>Thamar</i> all
have certain points in common; so have <i>Les Sylphides</i>,
<i>Carnaval</i>, and <i>Papillons</i>. There is a resemblance
between <i>Daphnis et Chloë</i>, <i>Narcisse</i>, and
<i>l’Après-midi d’un Faune</i>. But it is easy to vary
these likenesses by not putting them into juxtaposition,
by mingling them with the bizarre <i>Petrouchka</i>,
the barbaric Polovtsian dances from <i>Prince
Igor</i>, the idealistic <i>Spectre de la Rose</i>, with
Weber’s <i>Invitation to the Dance</i> as its accompaniment,
the gorgeous and pompous <i>Legend of
Joseph</i>, the frivolous <i>Midas</i>, the exotic <i>Le Dieu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
Bleu</i>, or the pageantry of the dances from Rimsky-Korsakow’s
<i>Sadko</i>.</p>

<p>It is impossible, of course, to ignore the genius
and virtuosity of individual interpretation entirely
in a study of the Russian Ballet, minimize as one
may its importance. There have been very many
pages written in an attempt to capture the charm
and genius of Nijinsky on paper. He has been
described variously as “half-human, half-god,” as
a tongue of flame, and as a jet of water spurting
from a fountain. The word “youth” expresses
something of the wonder of this marvelous boy.
He never seems to be doing anything difficult, and
yet his command of technique is incredible. He
always seems spontaneous, and yet I have been
told that, like Olive Fremstad, he does not make
the slightest movement of a finger which has not
been carefully thought out. He seems to me to
be the greatest of stage artists (and I include all
concert musicians as well as opera singers and
actors in this sweeping statement). I mean by
this that he communicates more of beauty and emotion
to me as a spectator than other interpretative
artists do. All impressions of this sort are necessarily
personal, but they do not for that reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
lack value. It is essential, however, to see Nijinsky
in a variety of parts to get his true measure.
As the lover of the sylphs in <i>Les Sylphides</i> he is a
pale <i>efféminé</i>, a Chopiniac, a charming Aubrey
Beardsley drawing, a lovely thing in line, and
grace, and sentiment. In <i>Petrouchka</i> he is a puppet,
and—remarkable touch—a puppet with a soul.
His performance in this ballet (the characters are
marionettes, but the story is something like that
of <i>Pagliacci</i>) is, perhaps, his most wonderful
achievement. He suggests only the puppet in action;
his facial expression never changes; yet the
pathos is greater, more keenly carried over the
footlights, than one would imagine possible under
any conditions. I have seen Fokine in the same
rôle, and although he gives you all the gestures,
the result is not the same. It is genius that Nijinsky
puts into his interpretation of the part.
Who can ever forget Nijinsky as Petrouchka when
thrown by his master into his queer black box,
mad with love for the dancer, who, in turn, prefers
the Moor puppet, rushing about waving his
pathetically stiff arms in the air, and finally beating
his way with his clenched fists through the
paper window and cursing the stars? It is a more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
poignant expression of grief than most Romeos
can give us. <i>Jeux</i> shows us the love games of a
trio (two women and a man) searching for a tennis
ball in a garden at twilight. It recalls itself
to me chiefly for the <i>glissando</i> (the music is by Debussy)
with which the ballet begins as the tennis
ball bounces across the stage, followed by Nijinsky,
who bounds across the broad stage of the
Théâtre des Champs-Elysées in Paris in two leaps.
These leaps are triumphs of dexterity, grace of
motion, and thrill, and he does not waste them.
They have given rise to the rumor that Nijinsky’s
element is the air. In <i>l’Après-midi d’un Faune</i> he
makes only one of these quick movements, but with
such astonishing effect that on one occasion (it was
the third time I had seen this stage arrangement
of Debussy’s prelude to Mallarmé’s poem) my companion,
a well-known dramatic critic who sits stolidly
through performances by all the great tragedians,
burst into tears. In <i>Sheherazade</i>, as the
black slave of the harem who dominates the story
of the ballet, Nijinsky utilizes his leap to dominate
the bacchanale, which is the climax of that piece
of sensual excitement. As the crowd of women,
wives of the sultan, and black slaves, drunk with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
wine and lust, enter into the wildest dance, the
negro in silver trousers in the centre of the stage
leaps higher and higher straight into the air above
the heads of his companions.... The descent,
with the indescribable curve of the legs, is
something to be seen. In <i>Carnaval</i>, Nijinsky enacts
the Harlequin with great roguishness and impertinence.
To the piece called <i>Reconaissance</i> he
dances with Karsavina, as Colombine, the most entrancing
of polkas. His dancing of the piece
called <i>Paganini</i>, however, is most memorable. At
that point where the dominant seventh on E flat
emerges through a deft use of the pedal, he represents
the effect to perfection by suddenly sitting
down, as a writer on the “London Times” once
noted. It is not, as a matter of fact, as a mere
dancer that Nijinsky excels, although he <i>does</i> excel
even there, but it is in the poetic interpretation
of his rôle, the genius in his playing, that he expresses
so much more than his nearest rival. He
is incomparable as a dancer, as you may very well
see in works like <i>Carnaval</i> and <i>Les Sylphides</i>, in
which dancing dominates the action; but even in
these ballets he never loses sight of characterization,
and the shaded values of ensemble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>Tamara Karsavina is a very beautiful woman,
although her beauty has not the subtle quality of
the more gifted Anna Pavlowa. She is an artist
and a fine dancer, a mime of great talent. She
fits more perfectly into an ensemble scheme than
Pavlowa, who was once a member of this organization
herself. She is delicate and flower-like and
she suggests vice with a great degree of verisimilitude.
Her Salome, with the painted roses on her
nude knees and breasts, is a fragile bit of decadence.
As the temptress Queen of <i>The Golden
Cock</i> she suggests the strange perverted power of
a Kundry, an Astarte, or a Loreley. In <i>The Legend
of Joseph</i> it is her duty to sit at a table without
changing her expression throughout almost an
entire act. It is a difficult task; one must perceive
the depths of the woman’s boredom, which does not
express itself even in impatience, and she must
dominate the scene. She accomplishes her tasks
beautifully, as she does also the long walk across
the stage in stilted Venetian shoes at the close of
the scene. In <i>Petrouchka</i> she is a fitting companion
to Nijinsky, and her little dance with the
cornet is a delicious and entrancing moment; her
Chloë is exquisite, soft, Greek, and girlish, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Ravel’s ballet and in Florent Schmitt’s <i>Salome</i> she
dances <i>on her toes</i> in bare feet (remember that half
the so-called “toe-dancers” resort to padded and
reinforced slippers for their power). I never lack
enthusiasm for Karsavina; but I cannot place her
near Nijinsky.</p>

<p>The crescendo of eulogy with which these notes
progress seems unavoidable. If one is in sympathy
with the aims of this group of artists (Gordon
Craig is not, I believe), one must recognize the
success with which they have carried them out.
Naturally, there are flaws. Doboujinsky’s costumes
for <i>Midas</i> are certainly very hard in color;
Steinberg’s music for the same ballet, a series of
futile brass blares; the story itself (Bakst <i>should</i>
confine himself to painting), a bore. Miassine is
scarcely the dancer one would have chosen for so
important a rôle as Joseph, which, on the other
hand, he is suited to physically. Karsavina’s portrayal
of the ultimate emotions of Potiphar’s wife
is a little unconvincing. I do not even admire
Bakst’s setting for his very lovely costumes in
<i>l’Après-midi d’un Faune</i>. But these are very small
insects in the amber of enjoyment.</p>

<p class="ph3">Strawinsky: A New Composer</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN America we are not accustomed to look to
performances of the ballet, which, after all,
is not an institution with us, for musical
manna. There have doubtless been ballets given
here with music by composers whose names occur
in Grove’s Dictionary, sometimes performed by a
fairly good band, but we have not expected, or received,
revelations on these occasions. Since the
Russian Ballet (the organization directed by Serge
de Diaghilew) has travelled to and fro in Europe,
Paris, and more especially London, have learned a
thing or two in this respect. For much of the
most interesting of the modern music has been
brought to these cities by the Russians, who include
not only ballet but also opera in their répertoire.
They are responsible for the productions,
outside of Russia, of Moussorgsky’s two operas,
<i>Boris Godunow</i> and <i>La Khovanchina</i> (this latter
music-drama was not produced by the Imperial
Theatres in Russia until over twenty years after
its publication in the Rimsky-Korsakow version.
Its presentation at Moscow took place after its
Paris and London performances, and at Petrograd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
only a month or so before!); Rimsky-Korsakow’s
operas, <i>Ivan the Terrible</i>, <i>A Night in May</i>, and
<i>The Golden Cock</i>; and Borodine’s <i>Prince Igor</i>. As
for ballets, Richard Strauss wrote <i>The Legend of
Joseph</i> for these dancers; Maurice Ravel, <i>Daphnis
et Chloë</i>; Debussy, <i>Jeux</i>; Reynaldo Hahn, <i>Le
Dieu Bleu</i>; Paul Dukas, <i>La Péri</i> (to be sure, this
work was finally produced under other auspices;
withdrawn by the composer from the Russians a
few days before the date set for the first performance,
on the ground that insufficient time had been
allotted for rehearsals); and Tcherepnine, <i>Narcisse</i>
and <i>Le Pavilion d’Armide</i>; but most important
of all are the three ballets (and the lyric drama)
contributed by Igor Strawinsky, who has, in a
sense, developed a new medium out of the orchestra
by writing a new language for it, although it
may be plainly seen that he is the logical descendant
of the really Russian composers (brushing
aside the Tschaikowsky-Rubinstein interlude; nationalism
was, of course, no object with these musicians).
There are suggestions of Strawinsky’s
style so far back as Glinka, in the Oriental dances
of <i>Russlan and Luidmilla</i>. You will find the germs
of his method in Borodine’s symphonies; from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
Moussorgsky to Strawinsky is but a step, especially
if you refer to the original text of <i>Boris Godunow</i>
and not the Rimsky-Korsakow version. In
fact, Strawinsky, in spite of his radical departures
from academic methods, is the inevitable defender
of the faith of the famous “Five” whose slogan
was “Nationalism and Truth.” As all real progress
in art is dependent, in a measure, on the past,
it is necessary to establish this fact.</p>

<p>My personal impressions of this young Russian’s
music and its effect on me are very strong.
I attended the first performance in Paris of Strawinsky’s
anarchistic (against the canons of academic
art) ballet, <i>The Sacrifice to the Spring</i>, in
which primitive emotions are both depicted and
aroused by a dependence on barbarous rhythm, in
which melody and harmony, as even so late a composer
as Richard Strauss understands them, do not
enter. A certain part of the audience, thrilled by
what it considered a blasphemous attempt to destroy
music as an art, and swept away with wrath,
began very soon after the rise of the curtain to
whistle, to make cat-calls, and to offer audible suggestions
as to how the performance should proceed.
Others of us, who liked the music and felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
that the principles of free speech were at stake,
bellowed defiance. It was war over art for the
rest of the evening and the orchestra played on
unheard, except occasionally when a slight lull occurred.
The figures on the stage danced in time
to music they had to imagine they heard and beautifully
out of rhythm with the uproar in the auditorium.
I was sitting in a box in which I had
rented one seat. Three ladies sat in front of me
and a young man occupied the place behind me.
He stood up during the course of the ballet to
enable himself to see more clearly. The intense
excitement under which he was laboring, thanks
to the potent force of the music, betrayed itself
presently when he began to beat rhythmically on
the top of my head with his fists. My emotion was
so great that I did not feel the blows for some
time. They were perfectly synchronized with the
beat of the music. When I did, I turned around.
His apology was sincere. We had both been carried
beyond ourselves. Later, when the public’s
attitude had assumed a more formal aspect, I had
a better opportunity for studying the score of this
ballet.</p>

<p>My second personal impression is a memory of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
an evening a few nights later, when I attended a
performance of Strawinsky’s earlier ballet, <i>Petrouchka</i>.
<i>Petrouchka</i> is another kind of entertainment.
It was a success with the public from
the beginning, and is still an important feature in
the répertoire of the Russian Ballet. It is by <i>Petrouchka</i>,
in fact, that Strawinsky will be introduced
to New York by the Russians during the
current season.... The curtains had closed
on these pathetic scenes from the Russian carnival.
They were drawn back to disclose Karsavina and
Nijinsky. Presently a third figure appeared, very
thin and short, with a Jewish profile (I do not
know, however, that Strawinsky is a Jew).
Dragged on the stage by Nijinsky, pale, awkward,
and timid, his near-sighted eyes blinded by the
footlights, the composer bowed his acknowledgments
to the applause, nervously fingering his eyeglasses.
This account would be incomplete without
a reference to his dress, as irreproachable in fit
and texture as that of Arturo Toscanini.</p>

<p>A London experience is also worth the telling.
It happened after the first performance there of
<i>The Nightingale</i>, a lyric drama to set a pace in
the race towards the future. There was a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
intermission after this short opera before the continuation
of the bill, which included a performance
of <i>The Legend of Joseph</i>, the composer himself
conducting, and Steinberg’s <i>Midas</i>. In the foyer
I met my friend Alfred Hertz. Those who know
this conductor are familiar with his moods. Tired,
after a rehearsal of <i>Parsifal</i>, or excited before the
performance of a work which he is about to conduct
for the first time, he becomes <i>distrait</i> and unconversational
to a degree which would not seem
possible in a man who ordinarily is as fond of
anecdote as he is of Viennese pastry. I recognized
his mood on this occasion. Mopping his brow (it
was June), he was good enough to explain.</p>

<p>“I can’t stay here any longer,” he said. “It’s
very embarrassing. Strauss asked me to come. I
am here as his guest to hear <i>The Legend of Joseph</i>,
but I can’t listen to it. I’m too tired—I am
exhausted. I have never heard such extraordinary
music. I have never been so moved, so excited before
at the performance of a new opera....
Oh, if I could have the privilege of introducing
that work to New York, then I should be happy!”</p>

<p>I am very glad to quote these words to the lasting
honor of one who realized at once the pleasure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
that Strawinsky’s music, quite in a new mode, would
give to the coming generation, and to a few in the
present.</p>

<p>M. D. Calvocoressi, I believe, had the honor of
signing the first article in English about Strawinsky,
shortly after the production of <i>The Firebird</i>
in Paris. Mr. Calvocoressi is to musicians what
Mr. George Moore, who introduced Paul Verlaine,
Jules Laforgue, and Arthur Rimbaud to English
readers, has been to poets—an appreciator of contemporaries.
This is a rare trait, one not possessed
by John Runciman of the “Saturday Review”
or by several other prominent critics, whose
names instantly spring to mind. The initial article
in English about the young Russian composer
appeared in the London “Musical Times” for
August 1, 1911. Since then Mr. Calvocoressi has
written much on the subject, and a good deal of
his information seems to have been gleaned from
headquarters, since he quotes Strawinsky freely.
(This critic is, of course, particularly interested in
Russian music. He translated Balakirew’s songs
into French, and wrote a life of Moussorgsky.)
With the words of the composer as a guide, Mr.
Calvocoressi has made a most interesting discovery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
that in the lyric-drama music of this young man
“working-out” plays no part. There is no development
in the music of <i>The Nightingale</i>; the music
simply expresses what the text dictates it shall express
as it goes along. (In this respect, of course,
Strawinsky is but following an ukase of the “Five”
to its logical conclusion; they, in their desire to
create a national school, chose as the best means
of banishing any suggestion of Wagner, whose
theories were generally being blindly accepted and
adopted by composers of music-dramas at this
epoch, the banning of the use of the <i>leitmotiv</i>.
However, they repeated themes and melodies, and
Moussorgsky in <i>Boris</i> brings back the bells that
served to ring in Boris’s coronation, in broken
rhythm to ring out his life.)</p>

<p>In regard to this matter Strawinsky has put
himself on record as saying, “I want to suggest
neither situations nor emotions, but simply to
manifest, to express them. I think there is in what
are called ‘impressionist’ methods a certain amount
of hypocrisy, or at least a tendency towards vagueness
and ambiguity. That I shun above all things,
and that, perhaps, is the reason why my methods
differ as much from those of the impressionists as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
they differ from academic conventional methods.
Though I often find it extremely hard to do so, I
always aim at straightforward expression in its
simplest form. I have no use for ‘working-out’ in
dramatic or lyric music. The one essential thing is
to feel and to convey one’s feelings.”</p>

<p>This, of course, is a more elaborate version of
what Moussorgsky said, “Plain truth, however unpalatable,
and nothing more. No half measures;
ornamentation is superfluity.”</p>

<p>In one of Mr. Calvocoressi’s recent articles about
Strawinsky that critic says, in lines which illuminate:
“According to the modern conception of
the lyric drama, the chief quality of dramatic
music is terseness—a quality most uncommon in
all kinds of music, and which many will, not altogether
wrongly, think almost incompatible with
the very essence of musical art. The principle
of music as generally understood appears to be
amplification, repetition.</p>

<p>“At all events, the art of music has always consisted
chiefly in that of ‘working-out.’ And it
is but of late that a number of music-makers and
music-expounders have raised an outcry against
prolixity and redundance in music: an outcry, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
must be added, that for the present does not find
much echo among the majority of art judges nor
of the public.</p>

<p>“The first of great musicians to abjure the principle
of formal, elaborate ‘working-out’ in dramatic
and lyric music was Moussorgsky. A striking
peculiarity of his best songs and of his masterpiece,
<i>Boris Godunow</i>, is the absolute lack, not only
of anything resembling tautology or amplification,
per se, but of all that is not absolutely essential
to direct expression (including many devices which
no other musician of the time would have dreamt
of leaving out), even if the omission be in defiance
of tonal construction and balance.</p>

<p>“For instance, the song, <i>The Orphan</i>, ends very
dramatically on the suspensive harmony of the
dominant. <i>Death’s Lullaby</i>, which depicts a dialogue
between a horror-stricken mother and Death,
who comes to take away a child, ends abruptly on
the burden of Death’s last utterance, with which
the composer’s intention is fulfilled. He never gives
a thought to the practice of bringing back the
main key which would have led him either to an
inappropriate modulation or to a superfluous addition.
Similarly, <i>Boris Godunow</i>, in the authentic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
version, ends, without even a cadence, on a
chord that hardly leaves the impression of the
tonic.”</p>

<p>Mr. Calvocoressi points out the fact that there
are few passages for orchestra alone in <i>Boris</i> outside
of the <i>polonaise</i> and the very brief preludes
to the acts, and he asks us to observe the working
of the same principle in <i>Pelléas et Mélisande</i>, in
which it is evident that Debussy was influenced by
Moussorgsky. Schoenberg was the first to apply
this principle to orchestral music. However, if an
opera-goer finds much to enjoy in the dramas of
Moussorgsky and Strawinsky, it does not necessarily
follow that all the value of a work like <i>Die
Walküre</i> disappears, to his ears. The two principles
of art are different; each, perhaps, is equally
valid.</p>

<p>“But the fact is that a new factor has appeared
in the domain of dramatic music, which is now
entering a new path; and consequently a new order
of artistic pleasure may be the outcome of this
stage of evolution. The first consequence, of
course, is a greater differentiation between the
style of dramatic music and the style of instrumental
music; unquestionably a progress, since it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
widens the range of methods and gives greater
freedom to the composer’s imagination.”</p>

<p>All of this is very stimulating, and very true;
still, it cannot be said that audiences as a whole
grasp Strawinsky’s intention, as it is exploited in
<i>The Nightingale</i>, so readily as they do Moussorgsky’s
as manifested in <i>Boris Godunow</i>. Rimsky-Korsakow’s
emendations of the latter work, which
one critic has labeled as mutilations, may be responsible
for the greater public reaction. But the
success of <i>Boris</i> was by no means immediate. Produced
in Petrograd in 1874, it was not heard in
Paris until nearly thirty years later, nor in New
York until 1913. Musicians, in the meantime,
had had access to the score, and had adopted some
of the Moussorgsky idiom as their own. When
<i>Boris</i> was at last produced here it was not, therefore,
the utter novelty that <i>The Nightingale</i> now
seems. The very principle of the new music demands
a greater effort at concentration than can
be expected of most audiences when they are listening
to music, as many ears catch the meaning
of a phrase only after it has been repeated a convenient
number of times. This is one of the chief
reasons for the popular success of <i>The Ring</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
dramas. It seems incredible, and impertinent, to
the average audience that a composer should have
had the idea of expressing himself without repeating
himself. A catalogue of representative themes
would be of no use to a prospective auditor of <i>The
Nightingale</i>. Now, there are two advantages to
this method, aside from the implied advantage of
an improvement in effect: First, it makes for a
very short opera (<i>The Nightingale</i>, in three acts,
is so short that at its early performances it was
given in a bill with two ballets, one of which, <i>The
Legend of Joseph</i>, runs for over an hour); second,
the audience is not called upon to listen intellectually
(nor should it be, at the performance of an
opera). The only intention of the composer is
to make his listeners <i>feel</i> each situation he illustrates
with his music. It may be said that Wagner’s
intention was the same, and thereby lies the
difficulty in training listeners to understand the
new principle. Wagner’s way is easier for them
because they can get the emotional feeling <i>through
the intellect</i>. The repetition of themes would not
in itself assure an effect, but the labeling of these
themes does just that, so that whenever the Sword
<i>motif</i> or the Siegfried <i>motif</i> occurs, the <i>mind</i> of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
the listener, knowing the name of the theme, is perfectly
prepared to create the emotional reaction
demanded by the composer. Strawinsky appeals
directly to the emotions. On the listener who expects
a theme to reappear again and again he
makes only the impression of being a noise-maker
(in the sense of a worker in dissonance; <i>The
Nightingale</i> is most continent in sound). But
on the open-minded auditor his effect is usually
astounding.</p>

<p>The story of the music-drama closely follows
the Hans Andersen tale. In the first act a deputation
from the Chinese Emperor’s court, headed
by the kitchen-maid, seeks the nightingale in its
grove. The Imperial Chancellor, the Bonze, and
a number of courtiers are included in this strange
procession, which follows the kitchen-maid, as she
alone knows the bird’s song, to request the nightingale
to come to the court to cheer up the melancholy
ruler. Although loath to leave its quiet
groves, the bird agrees to go.</p>

<p>In the second act the nightingale’s arrival has
stirred the Emperor’s jaded senses. However, the
present of a mechanical bird which comes from
Japan diverts his attention. In the meantime, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
real nightingale has disappeared. The Emperor
orders the little brown songster banished from all
China, while he places the mechanical toy by his
bedside.</p>

<p>Death stands in the Emperor’s bedchamber in
the third act. Torn by his aching conscience,
the dying ruler calls in vain for his musicians to
make him forget. But the nightingale returns and
so charms Death with its songs that he agrees to
allow the Emperor his life. The Emperor revives
and offers his saviour a place at court, but the bird
refuses and returns to its woodland haunts with
the promise that it will sing each evening. Now
the courtiers enter, prepared to find the Emperor
dead. They are astounded when he sits up in bed
and bids them “Good-morning!”</p>

<p>All the symbolism, all the undercurrents of suggestion
contained in the text are never explicitly
referred to except in the brief utterances of a
minor character, the fisherman, who sings a prophecy
or an explanation at the beginning and end
of each act, foretelling the delight that will be
caused by the songs of the bird, the distress that
will follow its departure, and its final victory over
Death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>The book offers exceptional opportunities for
excursions into imitative music such as Richard
Strauss, to name one composer, would take delight
in expanding into pages of detail, as many of the
diverting incidents of Andersen’s tale are carried
over into the drama. In the first act, for example,
the courtiers mistake the croaking of frogs and
the lowing of cattle for the song of the bird; in
the second act the ladies of the court fill their
mouths with water and gargle in an attempt to
imitate the nightingale’s trill. These distractions
do not serve to steer Strawinsky from his direct
course. He notices them, of course, but in the
briefest and most concise manner.</p>

<p>The score of <i>The Nightingale</i> calls for a large
orchestra, although for a continent use of it. The
list of instruments includes wood-winds by threes,
with a piccolo, clarinet, bass clarinet, and double-bassoon,
three trombones, tuba, and two cornets
besides the usual two trumpets; two harps, two
glockenspiels, a celesta, a pianoforte (this part is
very important), and the whole of the usual percussion,
to which are added small antique cymbals.
The parts of the nightingale and the fisherman are
also sung from the orchestra pit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>The work was begun in 1909 (this date is disputed)
and completed in 1914, when it received
its first hearing in Paris in May. Strawinsky
seems to have found difficulty in composing it. “I
can write,” he is reported to have said, “music to
words, viz., songs; or music to action, viz., ballets.
But the coöperation of music, words, and action is
a thing that daily becomes more inadmissible to
my mind. And even should I finish <i>The Nightingale</i>,
I do not think I shall ever attempt to write
another work of that kind.”</p>

<p>Igor Strawinsky was born June 17 (June 5,
Russian style), 1882, at Oranienbaum, near Petrograd.
This date has been in dispute, and various
authors have disagreed about it. My authority is
Mr. Strawinsky himself. He was the son of a court-singer
and was destined to study law. But, working
assiduously with a pupil of Rubinstein, he became a
remarkable pianist from the age of nine. He encountered
Rimsky-Korsakow at Heidelberg in 1902
(when he was 20), and that Russian composer had
a great influence on his career, although very little
on his musical style. During this period Strawinsky
attended concerts, visited museums, and delved
in literature. Everything in the world of art is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
said to have awakened his curiosity. In 1903 he
wrote the <i>allegro</i> of a sonata for the piano, of
which the <i>andante</i>, <i>scherzo</i> and <i>finale</i> were completed
the following year. Rimsky-Korsakow had
accepted him as a pupil, and while the young man
alarmed the older composer to some extent, he secretly
predicted great success for the only one of
his pupils who showed revolutionary tendencies.
Strawinsky says that the composer of <i>Sheherazade</i>
struggled valiantly with himself at this period in
an effort not to restrict what might be beautiful in
his pupil’s anarchic methods, at the same time
wishing to preserve his own ideals. In 1905-6
Strawinsky worked at orchestration, and during
this period, as an exercise, he orchestrated his master’s
opera, <i>Pan Voyevode</i>, from the piano score.
Subsequently his work was corrected by comparison
with Rimsky-Korsakow’s own scoring, recently
completed. This might have been a dangerous
exercise for a “sedulous ape,” but Strawinsky was
not that. He also orchestrated marches of Schubert
and sonatas of Beethoven. His friends at
this time were the group surrounding Rimsky-Korsakow,
Chaliapine, César Cui, Glazunow, and
Blumenfeld, the <i>chef d’orchestre</i>. Strawinsky was
married January 11, 1906.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>Soon after his marriage he terminated his symphony
in E flat (1905-7). It was performed in
1907, and was published later by Jurgenson. A
song with orchestral accompaniment, <i>Le Faune et
la Bergère</i>, dates from this period (1906), and in
1908 he completed his <i>Scherzo Fantastique</i>, which
was inspired by a reading of Maeterlinck’s “Life
of the Bee.” This has been played in Paris. Edward
Burlingham Hill says of it: “In its long
passages for staccato strings, divided into melodic
phrases for wood-wind instruments and in fanciful
figures for wind instruments, celesta, and harps,
one can imagine the sinuous and yielding swaying
of bees, iridescent with color, and pulsing with
life.” I do not think this work has been played in
America. New York has not heard it. He
set two poems of Gorodetzki to music in 1908.
When Rimsky-Korsakow’s daughter married Maximilien
Steinberg in 1908, Strawinsky sent <i>Fireworks</i>
as a wedding present, but before the post
had delivered the gift the older composer was
dead. As a tribute to his master’s memory Strawinsky
composed the <i>Chant Funèbre</i>, performed at
the Belaïeff concerts. <i>Fireworks</i> has been played
in New York both by the Russian and the New
York Philharmonic Societies. Four piano études,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
written in the summer of 1908, have stood on my
piano for some time. They are interesting. Vuillermoz
says that Strawinsky began <i>The Nightingale</i>
in this year; Calvocoressi’s date is 1910; the
programme at the first performance gave the date
as 1909.</p>

<p>About this time an incident occurred which considerably
changed the young composer’s outlook,
and which brought him to the attention of a larger
world. He was “discovered” by the director of
the Russian Ballet, Serge de Diaghilew, and commissioned
to write a ballet on a Russian folk-story
scenario fashioned by Michel Fokine. Leon Bakst
and Golovine, the painters, completed the collaboration.
The work, <i>The Firebird</i>, was terminated
May 18, 1910, and produced three weeks later.
The first sketches for this ballet must have been
written before the death of Rimsky-Korsakow, if
we are to believe a very delightful story told somewhere
by Calvocoressi. On hearing Strawinsky
play some bars of <i>The Firebird</i>, the older composer
is quoted as saying: “Look here, stop playing
that horrid thing; otherwise I might begin to enjoy
it!” The production of <i>The Firebird</i> established
the composer’s reputation in Paris, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
very impressionists whose methods he has dubbed
“hypocritical” were among the first to sign themselves
his admirers. Of these Maurice Ravel was
the leader. <i>Petrouchka</i> was completed just a year
later (May 26, 1911), and its production by the
Russian Ballet gave his fame a firm hold with the
public. His third choreographic drama, <i>The Sacrifice
to the Spring</i>, followed in 1913, and his
opera, <i>The Nightingale</i>, in 1914. Several songs,
including <i>Le petit Myosotis</i> and <i>Le Pigeon</i>, are
other products of recent years.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>It is astonishing to learn that <i>The Nightingale</i>
was begun so early in the composer’s career, but
it is still more astonishing to discover that the
first sketches of <i>The Sacrifice to the Spring</i> were
written before <i>Petrouchka</i> was conceived. That
ballet, which achieved the great honor of being
hissed in Paris (I have described the incident earlier
in this article), is the work on which, with <i>The
Nightingale</i>, rests his chief claim to being a composer
with something new to say. The work differs
from most of the mimed dramas given by the Russians
in that it is practically without a fable. The
scenes take place in barbaric Russia, long before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
the Christian era, and we are introduced to rites
connected with the worship of the soil and the
springtide; after a series of ritual dances, one of
the younger maidens is chosen as a sacrifice to the
spring, whereupon she spares her friends the
trouble of killing her by dancing herself to death.
This exceedingly angular dance, the expression of
religious hysteria, marvelously conceived by Nijinsky
and thrice marvelously carried out by Mlle.
Piltz, was one of the causes for the outbreaks at
the early performances of the ballet.</p>

<p>The lack of a fable, the early and uncertain setting
of the action, offered Strawinsky an opportunity
which he seized with avidity. The music
is not descriptive, it is rhythmical. All rhythms
are beaten into the ears, one after another, and
sometimes with complexities which seem decidedly
unrhythmic on paper, but when carried out in performance
assume a regularity of beat which a
simple four-four time could not equal. H. E.
Krehbiel, in his valuable book, “Afro-American
Folksongs,” describes the tremendous effect made
on him by the intricate rhythms (which he tried
in vain to note down) of the musicians of African
tribes at the World’s Fair in Chicago. The rhythmic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
effect of <i>The Sacrifice to the Spring</i> is as
powerful and complex. It is interesting to remember,
in this connection, that the ancient Greeks accorded
rhythm a higher place than either melody
or harmony. Strawinsky describes the dawn of a
spring morning in a few measures at the beginning
of the prelude (here, it must be admitted, there is
a startling reminder of <i>l’Après-midi d’un Faune</i>),
and then he settles down to the business, and art,
of providing material for dances. This he has
done with consummate effect. In many cases his
chord-formations could not be described in academic
terms; the instruments employed add to the
strangeness of the sounds. I remember one passage
in which the entire corps of dancers is engaged
in shivering, trembling from head to toe, to
music which trembles also. It makes my flesh creep
even to think of it again. At the beginning of the
ballet the adolescents pound the earth with their
feet, while a little old woman runs in and out between
their legs, to the reiterated beat of a chord
of F flat, A flat, C flat, F flat; G, B flat, D flat, and
E flat, all in the bass (begin from below and
read in order), while an occasional flute or a
piccolo screams its way in high treble. Try this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
on your piano. “He has had recourse,” writes
Edward Burlingham Hill, “to a violently revolutionary
style which is difficult to reduce to a systematic
analysis. Chords employing minor and
major triads simultaneously in different octaves,
figures in double thirds, strange aggregations of
notes that can hardly be described as chords, even
with critical license, are the ingredients of this unusual
style.” M. Montagu-Nathan, in his “Short
History of Russian Music,” says: “In criticising
the work, the mistake was made of suggesting that
Strawinsky’s music had gone back to an elemental
stage in an endeavor to provide an appropriate setting
for the pre-historic. In reality, of course, the
movement was forward, in that music was used in
a sphere to which it had hitherto been strange.
That is progress. A composer who sets ‘The Creation’
to living music is just as progressive as another
who takes ‘The Last Judgment’ as his theme.”</p>

<p>Strawinsky seems to meet his problems according
to their nature with an inevitable sense of the fitness
of things. He has set, in <i>Petrouchka</i>, a story
of the Russian fair; the leading characters are
puppets; the period, 1830. The music is realistic
in tone, in some instances intentionally vulgar.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
It has been pointed out that the themes of the
nurses’ dance, the dance of the <i>cochers</i>, and the
Russian dance in the first scene, are founded on
Russian folk-tunes. There is all through the piece
an implied tone of a village carnival; the accordion
and hurdy-gurdy are never very far away, in
suggestion at least. The dancer, personified by
Mme. Karsavina, trips her lightest measures to the
fanfare of a cornet, and Petrouchka sobs out his
heart to the empty sky to the screaming of a piccolo.
There are tunes, real tunes, the piece
abounds in them, and the whole is wrapped in an
atmosphere of realism and truth which gives music
the tone of originality. Incidentally, there is a
triangle solo in the score.</p>

<p>M. Montagu-Nathan says: “The carnival music
is a sheer joy, and the incidents making a demand
upon music as a descriptive medium have been
treated not merely with marvelous skill but with
unfailing instinct for the true satiric touch. <i>Petrouchka</i>
is, in fact, the musical presentment of
Russian fantastic humor in the second generation.
There is none of the heavy scoring once thought
necessary to reveal the humorous possibilities of
some particular situation; Strawinsky lives in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
world which has learned to take things for granted,
and his method is elliptical. This perception of
proportion in humor is one of the surest indications
of refinement, and <i>Petrouchka</i> not only
testifies to the composer’s possession of this
quality, but provides an assurance that he has
a technical equipment which can hardly betray
him.”</p>

<p>The fable is one of love and hate in that fanciful
domain in which we become aware of the existence
of a soul hitherto considered absent from such a
corporeal habitation. Among the mingled crowd
of merry-makers and mountebanks at the carnival
is a showman, practiced in the black arts. In his
booth he exposes his animated dolls: the dancer,
flanked by Petrouchka, the simple fool, and the
fierce Moor. The three enact a tragedy of jealousy
which terminates in the “shedding of Petrouchka’s
vital sawdust.”</p>

<p><i>The Firebird</i> stirred another cell in the imagination
of this young Russian giant. Again he is
dealing with a Russian folk-tale, but it is a fairy
story this time, not a vulgar story of country life;
he has manipulated his orchestra into a thousand
gorgeous colors to illustrate it. The instruments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
revolve their tones kaleidoscopically, reflecting the
myriad hues with which Golovine and Bakst have
invested the scene. The rhythms are exotic; the
harmonies and the melodies of the utmost brilliancy.
One of the dances of the Firebird has a
haunting melancholy about it which seems to have
been wafted from the steppes.</p>

<p>The Firebird in the beginning of the action falls
a prey to the young Prince Ivan; as the price of
her freedom she offers him one of her plumes, which
he accepts while she flies away into the soft blue
shadows of the night. Dawn breaks, and Ivan
finds himself in front of a magic castle, from the
gates of which troop out a group of white-robed
maidens. They indicate by means of their leader,
Tsarevna, with whom Ivan at once falls in love,
that he must not venture inside, but as soon as they
have left him he rashly pushes back the great gate
in front of him. There is a crash and in a moment
out rushes pell-mell a huddled mass of slaves,
dancers, men in armor, and buffoons, who surround
him and drive him dizzy with their chatter. The
uproar works up to a <i>crescendo</i> of frenzy when
the monstrous figure of Kostchei, the Immortal,
the lord of the castle, stalks out to quell the din.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
Kostchei has already turned others into stone, but
over Ivan he has no power; the Firebird’s plume
protects him, and on his brandishing it before the
terror-stricken god the bird herself appears. At
first she makes the crowd dance; then she lulls them
to sleep and shows Ivan where the egg containing
Kostchei’s soul is concealed. He brings it out and
smashes it. The old god crumbles to pieces, the
stones are brought to life, and the lovers’ hands are
joined. The character of Kostchei is an important
one in Russian folk-lore; he is the subject of an
opera by Rimsky-Korsakow. Ralston, in his “Russian
Folk-Tales,” thus describes him: “Kostchei is
merely one of the many incarnations of the dark
spirit.... Sometimes he is described as altogether
serpent-like in form; sometimes he seems
to be of a mixed nature, partly human and partly
ophidian; but in some stories he is apparently
framed after the fashion of a man.... He
is called ‘immortal’ or ‘deathless’ because of his
superiority to the ordinary laws of existence....
Sometimes his ‘death’—that is, the object
with which his life is indisputably connected—does
not exist within his body.” It may be seen
that in almost every instance Strawinsky has followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
the lead of the “Five” in choosing material
closely associated with Russian folk-lore.</p>

<p>There came a reaction after the foundation of
the Russian national school by the “Five” (Cui,
Borodine, Rimsky-Korsakow, Balakirew and Moussorgsky),
and the result of foreign influence was
felt. These composers had worked, as most of the
Russian novelists have worked, with a sense of the
soil from which they had sprung; their compositions
are redolent with the mode and manner of
folk-music. They chose, in most instances, Russian
subjects for their operas. Moussorgsky in
particular effected a tremendous revolution in style,
developing a manner in which ornamentation and
affectation played no part; a tense simplicity and
sincerity marked all his music, which never asked
alms of conventional rules of composition. (I am
willing to say this quite in the face of Mr. Runciman,
who recently stated in the “Saturday Review”
that there were only two Russian compositions of
any importance, a symphony by Borodine and
Tschaikowsky’s fourth symphony. “Any other
two pieces of Russian music are as alike as two
mushrooms.”) Rubinstein and Tschaikowsky were
the leaders of the opposition, whose music is more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
akin to that of other nations. They actually succeeded,
for a number of years, in establishing themselves
in England, France, and America as the representative
Russian composers. And naturally
their immediate success was greater, even in their
own country, where individuals were trying to free
themselves from the curse of their birthright,
struggling up from the soil; culture was growing.
John Reed tells a wonderful story of a Serbian
peasant who, having assimilated some culture (in
Serbia <i>Kultur</i> is about twenty years old), was reminded
by the fields of Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony.
So the Russians, learning French, were
a thousand times more impressed with <i>salon</i> music
than they were with the work of their more national
composers. Moussorgsky, of course, has
only recently been dragged out of his retirement,
even now in somewhat modified form. (Neither of
his operas is produced as he wrote it; he died leaving
the orchestration of <i>La Khovanchina</i> unfinished;
Rimsky-Korsakow reorchestrated <i>Boris</i>—a
needless task, perhaps a desecration; he also wrote
a good deal of the orchestration of <i>La Khovanchina</i>;
the work was completed by Maurice Ravel
and Strawinsky in a more reverent spirit.) Strawinsky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
is the new giant upon whom has fallen the
mantle of Russian nationalism. His work is based,
primarily, on the work of the “Five,” all of whom
are dead. That he reminds one occasionally of the
modern Frenchmen only means that they, too, have
learned their lessons from Borodine and Moussorgsky;
Debussy’s debt to Moussorgsky has frequently
been acknowledged; it is obvious if one
compares <i>Pelléas et Mélisande</i> with <i>Boris Godunow</i>.
Strawinsky’s love of Oriental color is possibly an
inheritance from his master, Rimsky-Korsakow.</p>

<p>This young Russian has appeared in an epoch
in which the ambition of most composers seems to
be to dream, to write their symbolic visions in terms
of the mist, to harmonize the imperceptible. Strawinsky
sweeps away this vague atmosphere with
one gesture; his idea of movement is Dionysian;
he overwhelms us with his speed. One critic has
referred to him as the “whirling dervish of his
art.” His gifts to future composers are his conciseness,
his development of the complexities of
rhythm, and his invention of chord-formation.
His use of dissonance is an art in itself. Richard
Strauss has employed dissonance in obvious development
of Richard Wagner’s polyphonic and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
chromatic style. Pushed to its furthest, his system
is one of inversion. With Strawinsky the use
of dissonance is invention itself. He improvises
new chords, while Strauss is taking recognized
chords apart to make something else of them. So
this new figure stands for something in advance
of what has already been expressed. He is, perhaps,
the most vital of the modern forces in the
music world.</p>

<p class="ph3">Massenet and Women</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE name of Jules Massenet, spoken before
his tomb, should evoke many memories besides
the souvenirs of the delicate melodies
he wrote—memories of beautiful and frail women,
a long, exotic list, women whom he melodically
created in his operas and women whom he selected
to sing his heroines.</p>

<p>Xavier Leroux in his preface to the “Souvenirs,”
in which Massenet carefully describes his life, calls
him the <i>musicien de la femme</i>. His music is peculiarly
feminine—“melodically, sentimentally, sensuously
feminine,” says Philip Hale. “The Eve
of Massenet is a Parisian <i>cocotte</i>. His Mary Magdalen
is a <i>grande amoureuse</i> even after her conversion;
a true sister of Thaïs.”</p>

<p>Marie-Magdeleine, Eve, Salome, Manon, the
fragrant, who suggested a flower girl in the <i>Boulevard
des Capucines</i>; Chimène, inspired by the classic
Corneille; Esclarmonde, in which the astonishing
Sybil Sanderson rose to her fame; Charlotte,
who, according to Thackeray, having seen Werther’s
body “borne before her on a shutter, like a
well-conducted person went on cutting bread and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
butter”; the eternal Thaïs, who at first failed to
interest the jaded boulevards; the sanguinary
Anita, the girl from Navarre; Sapho, who never,
in the opera at least, was carried upstairs until
Mary Garden portrayed her; Cinderella, the faithful
Grisélidis, many times tempted; the Spanish
dancer, l’Ensoleillad and Nina in the opera <i>Chérubin</i>;
Ariane and her companions, Phèdre and Perséphone;
Thérèse, Dulcinée, and the Queen Amahelly,
all written for that “<i>grande tragédienne
lyrique</i>,” Lucy Arbell: it would seem that every
country and every period of history had been
searched for a complete survey of feminism.
And among the unproduced works which the
composer left in a completed form is a <i>Cléopâtre</i>!</p>

<p>And what a list of women has sung these parts!
Women whom Massenet wholly or partly adored;
women for whom he dropped precious dots of ink
on paper, instead of buying them pearls in the
Rue de la Paix; women for whom, in some instances,
he preserved his scores for years. For
Massenet was never hasty. He never gave a score
to an unworthy interpreter. In this connection it
is only necessary to remember that <i>Amadis</i>, completed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
in 1890, and <i>Panurge</i>, completed in 1910,
are not yet produced (1912).</p>

<p>Women reciprocated his love. Louis Schneider,
in his biography of the composer, puts it thus: “A
woman is like a child; she gives instinctively to the
person who loves her. This explains why his incessant
glorification of woman made all women like
him.”</p>

<p>And so, linked indissolubly with the name of
Massenet, we may recall the names of those who
helped him to build his fame as the feminist composer,
those who “created” in the theatre the atmosphere
he had devised for his characters. Five
names stand out in prominent relief: the charming
Marie Heilbronn, the ill-fated Sybil Sanderson,
Emma Calvé, Mary Garden, and Lucy Arbell. But
there are countless others: Marie Renard, who
“created” Charlotte and first sang Manon in
Vienna; Marie Delna, who brought <i>Werther</i> to
Paris; Lina Cavalieri, the first Ensoleillad in
<i>Chérubin</i>, who afterwards introduced Thaïs and
Manon to Italy, and later brought back Thaïs to
the répertoire of the Paris Opéra; Lucienne Bréval,
who was the first Ariane and Grisélidis; Marguerite
Carré, the first Nina in <i>Chérubin</i> and who assisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
in the revival of <i>Sapho</i> at the Opéra-Comique;
Mlle. Kousnezoff, the Fausta in <i>Roma</i>; Mme. Duvivier,
Salome at Brussels; Mme. Fidès-Devriès,
Salome at Paris; Pauline Viardot, the sister of the
great Malibran, who sang Marie-Magdeleine as
an oratorio at the Odéon, April 11, 1873; Lina
Pacary, who sang one season at New Orleans, who
was the first to sing the Magdeleine in operatic
form; Julia Guiraudon, the first Cendrillon; Aino
Ackté, the first Vierge; Joséphine de Reszke, sister
of two famous singers, who “created” the leading
feminine rôle in <i>Le Roi de Lahore</i>; and Mme. Galli-Marié,
the first Carmen, who honored the first performance
of <i>Don César de Bazan</i>. But the list is
interminable. What names does it not include?
What beautiful woman with a voice of the past
three decades does not receive a few words of gratitude
in the “Souvenirs”?</p>

<p>Of all the women, however, who have sung the
Massenet rôles the one most particularly identified
with the composer was Sybil Sanderson, the beautiful
California girl, whose career was as short as
it was brilliant. Massenet met her at a dinner
given by an American friend. She came with her
mother, described by the composer as being almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
as beautiful as her daughter. After dinner Miss
Sanderson asked the composer if he would hear
her sing. He consented affably, as was his custom—never
was there a more gentle man!—and
seated himself at the piano.</p>

<p>“You will excuse me,” she added, “if I do not
sing your music. That would be too audacious.”</p>

<p>She ended by doing something very much more
audacious: she sang the second air of the Queen
of the Night from <i>The Magic Flute</i>.</p>

<p>The composer’s feelings may be adjudged from
his remarks in his <i>Souvenirs</i>: “What a prodigious
voice! Three octaves, either <i>forte</i> or <i>pianissimo</i>!”</p>

<p>He did not waste any time. His publisher was
urging him to set a poem on a Byzantine subject,
<i>Esclarmonde</i>, to music, and, with Sybil Sanderson
in mind, he went to work directly on the score.
<i>Esclarmonde</i>, in which Massenet pays his tribute
to Wagner—the subject suggests <i>Parsifal</i> and
<i>Tristan und Isolde</i>, to say nothing of <i>Armide</i>—was
produced at the Opéra-Comique during the
Paris Exposition of 1889. It was given 101 times
before Miss Sanderson went to Brussels.</p>

<p>Before her début Sybil Sanderson was scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
known in Paris. It was rumored among artists
that Massenet had written an opera for a fair
Californian (she was the daughter of Judge S. W.
Sanderson, of the Supreme Court) who was being
trained by the master to play the title part, and
some few had seen Massenet dining at a restaurant
in the Rue Daunou with an American girl, accompanied
by a lady who, judging from the likeness
of the two, was probably her mother. Then came
her début, and all Paris was talking about La Belle
Sanderson, and the extraordinary range of her
voice.</p>

<p><i>Thaïs</i>, the famous opera of the monk and the
Alexandrian courtesan, was also written for Miss
Sanderson. While Massenet was composing it the
singer was appearing three times a week at the
Opéra-Comique in <i>Manon</i>. It was therefore for
that theatre that <i>Thaïs</i> was destined. However,
Miss Sanderson, like many another artist before
and since, moved by a sudden caprice, signed a
contract with Gailhard to sing at the Opéra, without
taking the trouble to inform Carvalho, then
manager of the Opéra-Comique. Massenet did not
hesitate. He wrote to Gailhard: “You have the
artist; the work must follow her!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span><i>Thaïs</i> was produced March 16, 1894—and
failed! At that time the book was considered a
trifle indelicate! Even Sybil Sanderson’s popularity
could not save it. In 1898 the work was revived
with Mme. Berthet in the title part. For
this <i>reprise</i> Massenet wrote a new scene in the oasis
and the scene of the ballet, which have always been
omitted in American representations, except in
Boston. Lina Cavalieri sang the work in Paris in
1907. Since then it has never been long from the
<i>affiches</i> of the Opéra, while in America it has become
one of the most popular of modern operas,
thanks to Mary Garden, who made her American
début in the title rôle, and subsequently prevented
Lina Cavalieri from singing it in New York.
While he was writing <i>Thaïs</i> Massenet always kept
a tiny figurine on his writing table. This had been
made for him by Gérome, and served him as his
present inspiration.</p>

<p>Here is the tribute that Massenet pays to Sybil
Sanderson in his “Souvenirs”: “Sybil Sanderson!...
It is only with poignant emotion that I
recall this singer struck by pitiless Death, in her
full beauty, in the glory of her talent. Ideal
Manon at the Opéra-Comique; unforgettable Thaïs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
at the Opéra; these rôles identified themselves with
her temperament, one of the most magnificently
gifted that I have ever known. An invincible vocation
called her to the theatre, there to become the
ardent interpreter of many of my works; but also,
for us, what joy to write operas and rôles for the
artists who realize our dreams!...</p>

<p>“The silent crowd which pressed on the way of
the cortège which led Sybil Sanderson to her last
home was considerable. Over it a veil of sadness
seemed to hang. Albert Carré and I followed the
coffin. We walked directly behind what remained
of her beauty, grace, and talent, and Carré, interpreting
the feelings of the people about us,
said:</p>

<p>“‘She was loved.’”</p>

<p>It is to the “Souvenirs” also that we must turn
for a description of the selection of the first Manon.
Mme. Carvalho sighed when she heard the music,
and breathed the wish that she was twenty years
younger, so that she might sing it. Characteristically,
Massenet dedicated the score to her. He
wanted Mme. Vaillant-Couturier, then singing an
operetta of Lecocq’s at the Nouveautés, for the
opera.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“She interested me greatly and, as I thought,
bore an astonishing resemblance to a young florist
of the Boulevard des Capucines. Without ever
having spoken [it must be remembered that this
book was written for Massenet’s grandchildren] to
this delicious young girl, I was obsessed by the
vision, and the thought of her was ever with me.
This was indeed the Manon whom I had seen, whom
I saw always before me as I worked.”</p>

<p>The manager of the Nouveautés would not let
Mme. Vaillant-Couturier go, but while they were
talking Massenet observed that Brasseur had his
eyes on a pretty gray hat with roses, which was
going up and down the foyer. The hat moved
toward the composer.</p>

<p>“A débutant then no longer recognizes a débutante?”</p>

<p>It should be explained that Marie Heilbronn had
appeared in Massenet’s first opera, <i>La Grand’
Tante</i>.</p>

<p>“Heilbronn!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Herself.”</p>

<p>She reminded him of his first opera and the part
she took in it, and in answer to his questions continued:
“No, I am rich, and yet, shall I confess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
it? I wish to go back on the stage; I am haunted
by the theatre. If I could only find a good rôle.”
Massenet told her of <i>Manon</i>, and that night, at
her insistence, he played the music through for
her at her apartment in the Champs-Elysées. It
was 4.30 in the morning when he was done. She
had been moved to tears, and from time to time
she would exclaim, “That is my life; it’s my
life!”</p>

<p>In speaking of Heilbronn’s death after the
eightieth odd performance of <i>Manon</i> the composer
says: “Ah, who will tell artists how faithful we
are to their memories; how attached to them we
are; the great grief which the day of separation
brings us? I should prefer to stop performances
rather than have the part sung by another.”</p>

<p>This in itself is beautiful, but read what he has
to say of her successors:</p>

<p>“Some time afterward the Opéra-Comique disappeared
in flames and <i>Manon</i> was not performed
for ten years. It was the dear and unique Sybil
Sanderson that revived the work at the Opéra-Comique.
She played at the two hundredth. A glory
was reserved for me at the five hundredth when the
part was taken by Mme. Marguerite Carré. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
months ago this captivating and exquisite artist
was applauded the night of the seven hundred and
fortieth performance. Let me be permitted to
salute in passing the fine artists who have also
taken the part: Mlles. Mary Garden, Geraldine
Farar (so reads the book), Lina Cavalieri, Mme.
Bréjean-Silver, Mlles. Courtney, Geneviève Vix,
Mmes. Edwina and Nicot-Vauchelet—and how
many other dear artists besides! They will pardon
me if their names do not come at this moment to
my grateful pen.”</p>

<p>Massenet wrote two operas for Emma Calvé, and
she appeared in four other of his works. <i>La
Navarraise</i>, London, June 20, 1894, and <i>Sapho</i>,
Opéra-Comique, November 27, 1897, were written
for her. She also sang Salome in <i>Hérodiade</i>, Chimène
in <i>Le Cid</i>, and the leading feminine rôles in
<i>Le Roi de Lahore</i> and <i>Le Mage</i>.</p>

<p>Adolphe Jullien, the French critic, says somewhere:
“Hors de Calvé pas de <i>Sapho</i> possible, aux
yeux du compositeur.” Yet when Marguerite
Carré sang this work, founded on Daudet’s famous
novel, at its <i>reprise</i> at the Opéra-Comique in 1909,
he wrote an entire new scene for her. Mary Garden
was the American Sapho, and was adversely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
criticised for her forceful acting in the early parts
of the play. Yet Jullien writes of Calvé:</p>

<p>“Mlle. Emma Calvé, c’est le cri général, joue et
chante avec une ardeur presque excessive le personnage
de Sapho, très-difficile à faire accepter
à l’Opéra-Comique, en passant de la langueur la
plus lascive à la violence la plus grossière, par example
quand elle injurie ses anciens amants qui
viennent de dévoiler son passé au malheureux Gaussin.”</p>

<p>Another Sapho was Georgette Leblanc, who also
created some excitement with an exceedingly immodest
conception of Thaïs.</p>

<p>Anita in <i>La Navarraise</i> shares, along with Carmen
and Santuzza, the honor of being one of the
three rôles of her varied répertoire which Calvé
was permitted to sing frequently in this country.
It was not long ago that she appeared as Anita at
the Manhattan Opera House, where she was succeeded
in it by Mme. Gerville-Réache. The work
is still in the répertoire of the Opéra-Comique (or
was, before the war began).</p>

<p>Although Mary Garden has done more to establish
Massenet’s reputation in this country than any
other singer, and has sung many of his operas successfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
in Europe, especially <i>Manon</i> and <i>Thaïs</i>,
Massenet wrote only one part especially for her,
the title rôle of <i>Chérubin</i>. <i>Chérubin</i> was produced
at Monte Carlo, February 14, 1905. He is the
same youngster immortalized by Beaumarchais and
Mozart. He is but seventeen in the Frenchman’s
opera, but his good looks and audacity make him
a veritable Don Juan.</p>

<p>Schneider wrote of Mary Garden in the title
part: “She is Chérubin himself, in flesh and bones;
she was the joy and delight of the evening. By
reason of her slenderness and agility, her easy and
graceful manner, with her innocent airs of conquest
and her naïve mien of vexation, she is truly
the irresistible youth in whose presence all hearts
surrender. And to think that M. de Croisset, only
the day before, insisted that his Chérubin should
not be played by a woman! His, perhaps, but not
that of M. Massenet.”</p>

<p>It was Oscar Hammerstein’s idea that Mary
Garden should perform another man’s part. Tired,
it is said, of the continuous assertions to the effect
that all his operas were written about women for
women, Massenet wrote <i>Le Jongleur de Notre
Dame</i>, in which the single female figure, that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
the Virgin, does not sing a note. It is interesting
to observe that this opera is dedicated to Mme.
Massenet. It was produced February 18, 1902,
at Monte Carlo. Paris heard it two years later.
When Mr. Hammerstein decided to produce it in
New York he asked Miss Garden if she would sing
the part of the Juggler, hitherto in every instance
sung by a man. She assented, and appeared in the
rôle at the Manhattan, November 27, 1908. Her
success in the rôle was immediate and continued.</p>

<p>Massenet, in the “Souvenirs,” speaks of the
affair: “I was a little frightened, I admit, at the
idea of the monk taking off his robes after the
play to put on a smart gown from the Rue de la
Paix. But before the triumph of the artist I bow
and applaud.”</p>

<p><i>Thaïs</i> introduced Mary Garden to America, and
it is in this rôle that she has achieved the greatest
popular success of her career. She has sung it
everywhere, from Paris to Brooklyn. She sang
<i>Sapho</i> three times in New York and <i>Grisélidis</i> a
few times.</p>

<p>“I sang the patient Griselda first at Aix-les-Bains,”
she once told a reporter. “The King of
Greece heard me, and said he didn’t think the part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
a suitable one for me. I wonder what he
meant!”</p>

<p>Miss Garden has also sung Manon, and Prince
Charmant in <i>Cendrillon</i>.</p>

<p>Massenet’s last inspiration was a contralto, Lucy
Arbell, who fired his brain to many creations. She
sang the rôle of Perséphone in <i>Ariane</i>. This goddess
of the nether world appeared only in one act
of this long opera, but into that act Massenet put
the most popular air of the score, the air of the
roses, “<i>Emmène ta sœur</i>.” After Ariane had been
performed sixty times at the Paris Opéra, Massenet
asked her how many times she had sung the part,
thinking she would have forgotten.</p>

<p>“Sixty,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Wrong,” he replied, “for you have repeated the
air of the roses every night. You have sung the
part 120 times!”</p>

<p>The part of Dulcinée in <i>Don Quichotte</i> was written
for Lucy Arbell. She sang it both in Paris
and Monte Carlo. It is said that before the first
performance she spent considerable time learning
to play the guitar, so that she could accompany
her air in the fourth act herself. <i>Thérèse</i>, <i>Bacchus</i>
and <i>Roma</i> all contain parts written with Lucy Arbell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
in mind. One cannot do better than close with
the picture evoked by Massenet in describing the
effect which the music of <i>Thérèse</i> had on his interpreter
when he first played it to her.</p>

<p>“At the first playing of the score to our <i>créatrice</i>,
Lucy Arbell, artist that she was, stopped me
as I was playing the final scene, where Thérèse,
with a cry of fear, sees the terrible cart bearing
her husband, André Thorel, to the scaffold, and
screams, ‘<i>Vive le roi!</i>’ with all her force, so that she
may be sure of joining her husband in his death.
It was at this instant that our interpreter, greatly
moved, stopped me and said, ‘I could never <i>sing</i>
that scene up to the end, because when I recognized
my husband, who gave me his name, who saved Armand
de Clerval, I should lose my voice. I ask you
to let me <i>declaim</i> the end of the piece.’ Great artists
alone,” concludes Massenet, “have the gift of
divining these instinctive movements.”</p>

<p class="ph3">Stage Decoration as a Fine Art</p>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE question of the use of “scenery” on the
stage is perpetually bobbing up, and as
perpetually it remains an unsolved question.
Specific instances of the dire harm that the
decoration can do to a play may be observed in
our theatres almost any week during the active
season. To take an example, let us mention one
of Mr. Sothern’s Shakespearean productions,
which had already been cut to run within the time-limit,
but which played from eight in the evening
until midnight because the “elaborate” settings had
to be changed frequently. The intermissions, as
a result, occupied more of the spectators’ patience
than the play. In another instance, a musical
comedy went to pot on the first night because the
stagehands could not handle the setting of the second
act with enough expedition. As a result, they
kept the curtain down for thirty minutes, a fatal
length of time in a playhouse devoted to frivolity.</p>

<p>John Palmer, in that book, quotation from which
is sheer delight, “The Future of the Theatre,” says
that this is the age of the “naturalist” drama, and
that as a result, when anyone tries to produce a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
“romantic” or “poetic” play, there is an attempt
made to wrap up the shortcomings of the performance
in elaborate upholstery.</p>

<p>“Why does the electrician or the costumier become
so much more important in poetic than in
naturalist drama? The electrician and costumier
become more important as the author and actor
become less competent of themselves to assert their
intention. Naturalist authors and naturalist
players are masters of their method. The poetic
dramatists and players are not. Poetic drama has
fallen upon evil times. The dramatist, being unequal
to his burden, the artificers in light and hair
and turpentine are invoked to help him sustain it.
In the mid-twentieth-century outburst of poetic
splendor, which will follow the foundation of our
national theatre, it will soon be realized how the
former degradation of the poetic drama was directly
measured by the importance yielded thereby
to the subordinate crafts. The quaint superstition
of to-day that the limelight man is an important
person in the raising of Cæsar’s ghost will disappear
when poetic drama of the future is lifted to
the level of the naturalist drama of to-day.</p>

<p>“Even to-day, when there comes an actor of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
genius who can present Shakespeare in the solid
flesh, it is possible for the least reflective play-goer
to realize how little it matters that the limelight is
not of the latest and best quality, or that paint
upon the scene is spread too thick. We have lately
had opportunities, within a single year, of measuring
Shakespeare as produced by Mr. Granville
Barker against Shakespeare as acted by Sir Johnston
Forbes-Robertson. Compare for a moment
Mr. Barker’s <i>Twelfth Night</i> with Sir Johnston
Forbes-Robertson’s <i>Hamlet</i>. Mr. Barker’s <i>Twelfth
Night</i> had every advantage that a producer can
bestow. Beautiful costumes against a decorative
background, excellent music, an intelligent revival
of the necessary apron, a very fair quality of
acting, rising in a few instances to an extremely
high level of accomplishment—all that the producer
as fine-artist has been able to discover was
tested and adapted for the occasion.</p>

<p>“‘Look here upon this picture, and on this.’</p>

<p>“Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson in his <i>Hamlet</i>
of 1913 seemed bent upon showing once for all
that production matters not at all when great acting
is toward. The Drury Lane <i>Hamlet</i> of 1913
showed not only that the actor and his author require<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
no artistic aid of theatrical haberdashers to
make their effect, but also that the actor and his
author, if they have as much genius between them
as will cover a penny piece, can unite and play
clean out of existence the ugliest daubs of the false
cardboard naturalism of the late ‘nineties.’ In Sir
Johnston Forbes-Robertson’s <i>Hamlet</i> was no borrowed
grace of the producing fine-artist. Sir
Johnston Forbes-Robertson had not even the advantage
of the poetic conventions to which his play
was originally fitted. He made his dramatic appeal
in spite of his conditions, rather than with
their assistance. Yet everyone open to the appeal
of Shakespeare had to declare that the total æsthetic
effect of Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson’s
<i>Hamlet</i> infinitely outweighed the total æsthetic effect
of Mr. Barker’s <i>Hamlet</i>.”</p>

<p>Now, this is the most specious kind of argument.
Of course, genius, even unclothed genius, is at all
times preferable to mediocrity decked in gauds,
but genius properly caparisoned is only added to.
If Forbes-Robertson’s interesting study of <i>Hamlet</i>
had been properly set, its effect would have been
even more vivid.</p>

<p>Let us take, for instance, the case of the Russian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
dancers. Anna Pavlowa is generally regarded
as the greatest of living women dancers. A similar
place is assigned Waslav Nijinsky among the male
dancers. And yet it cannot be said that Mlle. Pavlowa,
with her mediocre (in most instances) scenic
and choreographic accompaniments, makes the effect
that Nijinsky does surrounded by the Bakst
scenery and the elemental spontaneity of the superb
Russian ballet. Mlle. Pavlowa’s genius
creates the utmost enthusiasm; it awakens admiration
on every hand; but it would be more compelling
were it encased in the beauty which it suggests.</p>

<p>To take another example, let us regard the production
of <i>Boris Godunow</i> at the Metropolitan
Opera House. Seldom, at this theatre, have more
dramatic splendors been revealed than Adamo Didur
showed us in the title part; and never has such
adequate staging been seen there. The scenery
and costumes, in fact, were all a part of the Russian
equipment used in Paris a few seasons ago.
Mme. Fremstad’s Brünnhilde in <i>Götterdämmerung</i>
is an even more indisputable proof of genius than
Mr. Didur’s Boris (taking into account the Russian’s
close following of his model, Feodor Chaliapine),
but the setting of <i>Götterdämmerung</i> at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
Opera is so unimaginative, so unappealing, so unsuggestive,
that one has to forget that before one
can focus one’s attention on the compelling art
of the singing actress.</p>

<p>Of late years the item of scenery has become
more and more costly, more and more elaborate.
What does it mean, after all, the kind of scenery
we see? Who cares about the painted stumps of
trees, the ridiculous apple blossoms and the pink
drawing-rooms? A little simple staging would effect
a much needed reform in the American Theatre,
especially if it were coupled with a good play.</p>

<p>It is in Europe that attempts have been made
at reform. Some of them have been successful.
Gordon Craig has been accounted the inventor of
many of the ideas that are prevalent at present,
but like many other inventors, he neither had the
practical ability, nor perhaps the desire, to put
them into effect himself. Stanislawsky, Reinhardt,
and even Bakst, have all learned something from
him, and have turned his ideas to practical account.</p>

<p>At present Gordon Craig, ensconced in the
Arena Goldoni in Florence, is said to be at the
head of a great school which shall teach the art<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
of the theatre. He is, to be sure, surrounded by
a pack of boys with soulful eyes, who wear dirty-greens
and call him “Master.” These he takes
driving occasionally over the hills near Florence in
no other vehicle than a coach and four. When
this monumental anachronism passes through the
Piazza Vittorio Emmanuele, or down the Via Tornabuoni
with its crowd from <i>Patience</i> seated aloft,
the effect on the populace of Firenze La Bella can
be only faintly imagined.</p>

<p>Occasionally someone tries to effect an entrance
into the school over which this eccentric genius presides
and for which he issues pronunciamentos and
catalogues without number, to say nothing of advertisements,
and articles in “The Mask,” and <i>affiches</i>
which are pasted on the high walls of the
Italian and English towns. If the youth who is
hardy enough to make the trial succeeds in reaching
the great presence he may be deemed a lucky
mortal. Mr. Craig observes each newcomer from
carefully prepared peep-holes. One look convinces
him whether the prospective student has talent for
the arts or not; one look alone suffices. Once having
made up his mind, nothing changes it.</p>

<p>Robert Jones tried to invade the domain of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
Craig school last summer, but not once could he
get near the Master; not once could he get any
more information than that very vague sort which
is included in the catalogue. Jones, sick of trying
to get on in Florence, went to Germany and now
is one of Reinhardt’s props and aids. (He has
since done good work in New York.)</p>

<p>Another friend of mine who did not care to enter
the school had more success. He attained the
Craig presence.</p>

<p>“But how,” he asked, “do you intend to teach
music without teachers?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” answered Mr. Craig quite simply, “we
shall work away, driving nails into boards, or walking
in the country, and when we feel like it we
shall sing!”</p>

<p>And so the possessor of some of the best ideas
that have come to the theatre in recent years ingeniously
steps aside while others, with a view to
their more practical use, apply them to their own
purposes. (I need not refer to Adolphe Appia here.
I leave his case for a separate discussion.)</p>

<p>In the first paragraph of this article I emphasized
the practical value of simpler scenery for
plays which require frequent or sudden changes;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
but, of course, the artistic side far outweighs that.
The kind of scenery we see so much of in New
York really deceives nobody. The moment a human
being of three dimensions steps on the stage
you have that human being posing against badly
painted pictures. It is as if one should combine
statuary and painting.</p>

<p>The intention in current stage decoration seems
to be to intensify the lack of imagination on the
part of the spectator. Each part of what is called
the scenery of a play is so clearly defined that
there is no opportunity for the communication of
suggested feeling. The spectator sees at once
that he is looking at an imitation of the place,
scenery painted to look as much like the place as
possible. As a consequence he has the feeling,
after the first five minutes, if he has imagination,
that he is not in the place at all. When the photographic
accuracy wears away the lack of suggestion
becomes appalling. The commonplace is
scaled.</p>

<p>This is said, taking into account scenery which
has scarcely any plastic features—such scenery,
for instance, as is used to a great extent at the
Metropolitan Opera House, where rocks and rills,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
woods, templed hills and marble halls are painted
on flimsy drops. In palaces the architectural features
are depicted in the same naïve way, using the
word naïve in its worst sense. I believe that
scenery like this is intended to represent the real
thing just as much as a <i>papier-mâché</i> mill which
crushes the villain in a melodrama, and it succeeds
just as much.</p>

<p>This art, I think, came from Italy. At least,
most of the scenery that is painted in this fashion,
or the inspiration for it, comes from there nowadays.
May it not be possible that it is suggested
to the scene-painter by the houses one sees in the
small Italian towns, where windows with shutters
often are painted on the façade? The fantasy of
some of these windows is sublime. Occasionally,
persons are painted looking out of them. Dogs
sit on the sills; I have seen peacocks. In some instances
the whole architecture is painted on the
outside of the house—columns, balconies, and all.
This is a familiar enough device in Italian churches,
and I fancy many Catholic churches in America
may show traces of the style.</p>

<p>Carl Hagemann of Germany tries to get away
from this sort of thing, just as David Belasco has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
tried to in New York, by making his whole scene
plastic, every object built separately inside of a
sky drop which runs around from one proscenium
arch to the other. If he uses a house or a tree or
a bench, it is not painted on the drop. It is built.
In the case of interiors his task is easier, of course.</p>

<p>This method of procedure has two distinct disadvantages.
In the first place, it takes away all
the charm of suggestion, which I think should
play an important part in theatrical entertainment,
and in the second place, it does away with
the possibility of producing a play with more than
one scene in each act, unless the producer happens
to have a revolving stage in his theatre, an equipment,
by the way, which every playhouse in New
York should possess. Hagemann gave Goethe’s
<i>Faust</i>, which has countless scenes, by means of a
revolving stage. He has produced Shakespearean
plays in this manner. Mr. Belasco has followed
Hagemann’s method pretty closely in some of his
recent productions. <i>The Auctioneer</i> is a play, it
seems to me, which needs this kind of scenery, if
anything does. <i>A Good Little Devil</i>, on the other
hand, would have benefited greatly by more imaginative
treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>Gordon Craig, of course, would substitute suggestion
for realism. He uses a combination of
screens, occasional draperies, and little else, to gain
his ends. The lighting is all from above; the natural
lighting in this world. If your floors were
made of glass under which were concealed hundreds
of glaring electric lights, you would get the
effect that footlights give on the stage.</p>

<p>It seems to me there are few romantic or poetic
plays which would not be improved by Craig’s
method of staging; and yet he has had little practical
experience in putting on pieces. Sets of
model scenes for <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>Macbeth</i> have been
exhibited in London. I think Beerbohm Tree used
adaptations of one of these at one time. Certainly
Craig’s <i>Hamlet</i> was seen at Stanislawsky’s Theatre
in Moscow. It is highly probable that Isadora
Duncan’s dancing background is a fancy of Gordon
Craig’s. However, little of the practical work
of this man has reached the public, except
through his books, which are verbose and vague
except in spots; and through his conversation,
which is usually said to be unillumined even by
flashes.</p>

<p>Craig worked at Moscow for a considerable time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
however, and it is probable that from the point of
view of staging, Stanislawsky now leads the world.
He has adopted some of Craig’s ideas and fitted
them to others until he has obtained a formula for
staging every play from <i>Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme</i>
to <i>Hedda Gabler</i>. This theatre is the direct
antithesis of the Opéra-Comique in Paris,
which has obtained such a false reputation for good
staging.</p>

<p>The Opéra-Comique clings stolidly to the Italian
method of using flimsy drops, with every detail
carefully painted thereon, combined with plastic
objects, the whole painted in pastel or primary
colors in a manner to suggest a St. Valentine’s
gift of the 1850 period. The lighting is usually
excellent. There are no innovations to be looked
for at the Opéra-Comique at present, which holds
as fast to its traditions as if the Russian Ballet had
never been seen in Paris.</p>

<p>Max Reinhardt and Leon Bakst have utilized
Craig’s ideas in a measure, but they have altered
them to a degree where they have become unrecognizable.
Reinhardt is known in New York by
<i>Sumurun</i>, one of his slightest productions. Still,
it gives a good idea of his impressionistic use of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
flat surfaces to create atmosphere and a colorful
background to his picture.</p>

<p>Leon Bakst, who has designed many of the famous
ballets which the Russians give in Paris and
other Continental cities from time to time, proceeds
on a more lavish scale. There are no plastic
features in a scene by Bakst. Everything is
painted on flat canvas, but the barbaric gorgeousness,
the impressionistic and suggestive qualities,
appeal to the eye as no attempted copy of a
real scene could ever do. The number of colors
he uses in one scene is almost countless, and
yet the combination is always thrilling and
effective.</p>

<p>Bakst is better known for his <i>Sheherazade</i> than
for any other of his ballets, but he also designed
the scenery for <i>Carnaval</i>, <i>Thamar</i>, <i>Jeux</i>, <i>Daphnis
et Chloë</i>, <i>Narcisse</i>, <i>l’Après-midi d’un Faune</i>, and
<i>Le Spectre de la Rose</i>.</p>

<p>He has further utilized his supreme talent for
decoration in staging the dramas in which that
Russian mime, Ida Rubinstein, has appeared at
the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris during recent
seasons: Oscar Wilde’s <i>Salome</i>, Verhaeren’s <i>Hélène
de Sparte</i>, and d’Annunzio’s <i>Le Martyre de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
Saint-Sébastien</i> and <i>La Pisanelle, ou la Mort parfumée</i>.</p>

<p>It was in this last play, produced in Paris in
the spring of 1913 for ten special performances,
that Bakst expressed himself perhaps more personally
than he had hitherto been able to do. Unlimited
means were placed at his disposal. He had all
the money he wanted and an exactitude in color, in
scene and costume, was aimed at which required the
dyeing and redyeing of many stuffs, and the
searching through countless shops for others.</p>

<p>The scene in the port, with the ship of the blood-red
sails painted against a sky of blood-red clouds,
in front of which figures garbed in scarlet, vermillion,
maroon, rose, mulberry, carnation, and other
shades of this brilliant color carried on the drama,
will not soon be forgotten by those who saw it. In
the final scene Bakst combined black, white, green,
orange, rose, and magenta in the most extraordinary
manner. In this play, too, he utilized a series
of curtains of different colors, according to the
scene, which hung half the depth of the stage on
either side. And back of the proscenium arch, also
on either side, was builded a column of gold, each
column divided into numberless small pillars, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
the mass which supports the ribs of a vaulted roof
of a great Gothic cathedral.</p>

<p>This season Bakst has staged two new ballets
for the Russians, Richard Strauss’s <i>The Legend of
Joseph</i>, in which Paolo Veronese is suggested in
the superb Venetian robes, and <i>Papillons</i>, which
calls into play the same qualities Bakst had already
exhibited in his designs for <i>Carnaval</i>.</p>

<p>The new school of scene-painting in Russia is
said to have been the inspiration of the painter
Wronbel, who, however, did not do much himself, as
he died before his ideas were fully accepted. Bakst,
Alexandre Benois and N. Roerich took up the work.
To Roerich we owe the <i>décors</i> of the ballet <i>The Sacrifice
to the Spring</i>, devised by Nijinsky to carry
out the ideas of the cubists, and which aroused
storms of hisses whenever it was given in Paris.
Alexandre Benois painted the scenes for <i>Petrouchka</i>
and also those for <i>Le Pavilion d’Armide</i>. Serge
Soudeikine is responsible for the decorations used
in <i>La Tragédie de Salomé</i>, and Theodore Fedorowsky
painted the extraordinary scenes for Moussorgsky’s
music-drama, <i>La Khovanchina</i>. The costumes
of the Persian ballet in this opera, of orange, with
vivid patches of green and blue, rest in the memory.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
The art of the Russians, it seems to me, has
found nearly complete expression. It is impossible
for them to go much further in their violent riots
of color, their barbaric impressionism.</p>

<p>It is a style particularly suited to the Russian
Ballet performances; the effect makes a complete
whole which those who have seen it cannot erase
from the memory. Its practical application to
other branches of theatrical entertainment is more
difficult. Certain plays of Shakespeare could be
dressed in this manner. Certainly <i>The Pirates of
Penzance</i> and <i>Patience</i> would be superbly fitted by
it; so would the music-dramas of Gluck, Wagner,
and Richard Strauss.</p>

<p>But there is still another source from which one
might set the plays of Shakespeare, leaving aside
the best way, which would be to give them in front
of screens and draperies in the simplest manner
possible. It often has occurred to me while wandering
through various European galleries that
the work of the early Italian painters might easily
be adapted to the uses of stage decoration. Florence
is full of this sort of thing, but three pictures
I remember especially—three pictures of the fifteenth
century, by an unknown painter. They are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
small and they hang, with other pictures between
them, in one of the long galleries of the Uffizi.
Two of them represent feasts. The simplicity and
coloring of the architecture and the costumes
would be joyously in keeping with certain plays of
Shakespeare. The famous <i>Marriage of Boccaccio
Adimari with Lisa Ricasoli</i>, in the Ancient and
Modern Gallery in Florence, is another example.
This train of splendid ladies and gentlemen, with
a background of old Italian houses, would make as
fine a stage pageant as one could wish for. One
of its features is a bench with a cloth thrown over
it, which would occupy the entire length of the
front of the stage. Over this an awning is spread,
under which the procession walks.</p>

<p>Numberless other examples of first aid to a producer
who wants to do something new with Shakespeare
could be mentioned. I cannot resist a passing
reference to the frescos of Benozzo Gozzoli in
the Palazzo Riccardi in Florence. The subject of
the frescos is The Gifts of the Magi; what the
artist has really shown is a Medici hunting party.
The paintings, in a perfect state of preservation,
depict youths in the most exquisite garments in
which any actor could hope to disport himself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
The combination of the greens, the purples, the
blues, and the mulberries, all intertwined with the
most lavish use of gold, would make such a stage-picture
as has not been seen since the days when a
desire for beauty and not a desire for photographic
accuracy—which always defeats itself—governed
those who put drama on the stage.</p>

<p class="ph3">Adolphe Appia and G. Craig</p>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IN the first edition of “On the Art of the
Theatre” (1911), Gordon Craig distinguishes
himself by killing off Adolphe Appia. In the
1912 edition of the book (and the subsequent editions)
he apologizes for his carelessness in a footnote
in which he refers to Appia as “the foremost
stage-decorator of Europe.” “I was told that he
was no more with us, so, in the first edition of this
book, I included him among the shades. I first
saw three examples of his work in 1908, and I wrote
to a friend asking, ‘Where is Appia, and how can
we meet?’ My friend replied, ‘Poor Appia died
some years ago.’ This winter (1912) I saw some
of Appia’s designs in a portfolio belonging to
Prince Wolkonsky. They were divine, and I was
told that the designer was still living.” There is
no other reference to “the foremost stage-decorator
of Europe” in this book. Now, Appia’s book, “Die
Musik und die Inscenierung,” translated from his
original French text by Princess Elsa Cantacuzène,
with eighteen plates from drawings by the author
for the settings for the Wagner music-dramas, was
issued by F. Bruckmann in Munich in 1899. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
is the book which Hiram Kelly Moderwell refers
to in “The Theatre of To-day.” Loomis Taylor,
last season director of the German works at the
Metropolitan Opera House, is also perfectly familiar
with it, and he related to me recently how
an attempt of his to bring Appia to Germany several
years ago failed. There is no mention made
by Gordon Craig of <i>any</i> book by Appia; Mr. Taylor
has read only the German text; and even Mr.
Moderwell seems to have been ignorant of the
fact that a previous work in French had been issued
by Appia.</p>

<p>I have in my possession a small volume (51
pages) entitled “La Mise-en-scène du Drame Wagnérien,”
by Adolphe Appia, published by Léon
Chailley in Paris in 1893. The sale was afterwards
(1895) continued under the imprint of the
well-known publisher, Fischbacher, 33 Rue de Seine.
There is no copy of this work in the New York Public
Library, nor in any other library that I have yet
consulted. (The later German work is comparatively
well known among artists of the theatre.)
The only reference to it that I have discovered is
in a footnote (Appia seems destined to be exiled
to footnotes) in a now little read work by Houston<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
Stewart Chamberlain, “Richard Wagner,” issued
in 1897, four years after Appia’s pamphlet had
first appeared. Appia dedicated “Die Musik und
die Inscenierung” to Mr. Chamberlain in this
fashion: “<i>à Houston Stewart Chamberlain qui
seul connaît la vie que j’enferme en ces pages</i>.”</p>

<p>There is enough interior evidence, without any
reference to chronological evidence, to give one
cause to presuppose a knowledge on Gordon
Craig’s part of these books, even the German version
of which appeared before Craig had developed
many of his theories. The chronology, for the
most part, is damning, for even in the short French
book (there is a reference in this pamphlet to the
fact that it is a condensed version of a longer work
which Appia feared might never see publication)
one may find not only the germs but also a complete
analysis of the principles of modern stagecraft.
It was Appia’s idea that the stage director
should use every effort, <i>by means of the decoration</i>
as well as by means of the actor, to bring out
the secret of the drama he was producing. Appia
was the first to see the inconsistency of placing the
actor against scenery with painted perspective. It
was Appia who foresaw that lighting should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
used for a more important purpose than mere illumination;
that it should serve as the element
which binds together the decoration and the figure
of the actor, a theory which, as Mr. Moderwell
points out, was imagined before a lighting system
had been devised to make its practical application
possible. It was Appia who discovered that although
Wagner had invented a new form of drama,
he had not the slightest notion of how to produce
it. He is very explicit here. He says, for example,
that the action of the ordinary opera is
determined by convention, that of the spoken
drama by life. In other words, the prima donna
of opera must sing her airs in conformation with
the beat of the conductor, and she may stand as
near the footlights as she pleases. No question of
art is raised; nor should there be. You cannot
improve (beyond a certain very easily discoverable
point) <i>The Barber of Seville</i> by superior
stage management. In a play the actor tries, as
best he may, to imitate life. Between his lines he
may take what time he likes to add action to best
serve this purpose. In Wagner’s <i>Wort-Tondrama</i>
(the master’s own expression) the music is used for
a double new purpose. It illuminates the soul of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
the drama, <i>le drame intérieur</i>, and it defines to a
nicety the <i>time</i> of the action (“not the duration of
time,” says Appia, “but time itself”). In other
words, the author-composer wished the illusion of
his music-dramas to be as complete as that of the
great tragedies of the spoken drama, but he has
set a definite limit to his characters’ actions by composing
music which it takes a certain time to perform.
He takes all liberty away from the actor
without telling him precisely what to do. Thus
Tristan and Isolde, after they have drunk the love-potion,
are given a number of moments, songless,
to express their emotion in gesture; just as Brünnhilde,
awakened by Siegfried, must continue to
greet the sun until the harp stops playing. Appia
foresaw that this action must be controlled by
one man, who must regulate it to the last detail.
He must arrange the scenery and the lights and
the action not only to correspond exactly to the
demands of the music and the words, but also to
bring out to the utmost the underlying meaning of
the work.</p>

<p>For this purpose he has gone into detail with
which it does not seem to be necessary to encumber
this brief account. In the German work this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
detail is, of course, much fuller than in the shorter
French version. The German book, besides, is embellished
with engravings which give one a very
good idea of the intentions of the artist-author.
Appia, for instance, is not content with making
one drawing for the setting of the third act of
<i>Die Walküre</i>; he makes no less than <i>seven</i>. These
show the varying condition of the lights and position
of the characters at different stages in the
action. Loomis Taylor has called Appia’s idea
for this setting “the most beautiful that one could
conceive.” And yet no one, so far as I know, has
ever attempted to use it. The Appia case is an
extraordinary one. Here we have a man who has
not only developed a complete and invaluable
theory for the production of a group of dramas,
but who has also gone to the pains to outline to
the minutest detail the manner in which his ideas
may be carried out, and no one has taken the
trouble to follow these instructions in the way he
intended. Once his work was complete, Appia
seemed content. He has now gone on to something
else. Before the war began he had identified
himself with the Dalcroze school at Hellerau and
had gone far beyond practical present-day stage-decoration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span> 
methods, evolving still newer theories
in cubes. However, may we not consider, with the
evidence, that Appia was the innovator of the new
movement in the theatre?—may we not assure ourselves
that without Appia there would have been no
Gordon Craig, perhaps no Stanislawsky? His
ideas have most certainly been awarded fruition in
a thousand forms.</p>

<p>I cannot resist a quotation or two in pursuit of
my comparison. “<i>Das Rheingold</i> presents three elements:
water (the bottom of the Rhine), air (the
summit of a mountain separated from Walhalla by
the Rhine), and fire (the subterranean forges of
the Nibelungs).” Compare this with Gordon
Craig’s now famous description of the decorations
for <i>Macbeth</i>: “I see two things. I see a lofty and
steep rock, and I see the moist cloud which envelops
the head of this rock. That is to say, a place for
fierce and warlike men to inhabit, a place for phantoms
to nest in.” But examples in which Appia
exacts of the decoration a promise to play a leading
rôle are too frequent to be quoted. One other
selection will show how this comparatively (to the
public) unknown designer went to work twenty-two
years ago to evolve a new form of stagecraft:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“The last tableau of <i>Die Walküre</i> represents a
mountain-top, the favorite meeting-ground of the
Valkyries. It is purely decorative up to the moment
when the god (Wotan) surrounds it with a
circle of flames to protect the sleep of Brünnhilde,
but from that instant it acquires a deep significance.
For this sleep is Wotan’s precaution against
the workings of his own desire; that is to say, the
god, having renounced his power to direct events,
has made the <i>confidante</i> of his desire impotent. This
fact gives the value of a dramatic rôle to the decoration,
since the return of the scene in <i>Siegfried</i> and
<i>Götterdämmerung</i> not only constitutes for the eye a
unity between the three parts of the trilogy but
also always leads the spectator to the vital point
in the drama (Wotan’s will, active or passive).”</p>

<p>Appia’s purpose, in every instance, was, working
from the general to the particular, to discover the
author’s intention and then to illuminate it. The
stage director or decorator, in his opinion, was only
the clairvoyant slave in the service of the author’s
text. The leaders of the modern movement in the
theatre are in complete accord with him on this
point as well as others.</p>
